3,Senet,,"Senet is one of the oldest board games known in the world, documented from about 3000 BCE until the first millennium BCE in Egypt. It was also played In Cyprus for most of that time, and played at different times in the Levant. Though a full ruleset has never been found, hints from texts and tomb paintings in Egypt give us clues about the manner in which it was likely played. The game was also heavily imbued with religious significance, as the board itself represented the journey through the afterlife.",528,529,,Egypt,1,1,Znt,,,,0,Eric Piette,,2399,"30°1'55.75""N, 31°4'31.13""E","530,3199",0,,0,0

5,XII Scripta,,"XII scripta (""twelve signs"") or ludus duodecim scrtiptorum (""game of twelve signs"" ) or, later, alea (""dice""), is a Roman game dating to the first cnturies CE that appears to be an ancestor of backgammon. Game boards that the form of 36 symbols, placed in three rows of twelve but divided in the middle by either a gap or other, larger signs, such as circles or rosettes. Sometimes the 36 symbols are letters, forming six six-letter words that form a poem or phrase, often relating to game play. One board, from Ostia, may indicate that game play started in the left hand side of the center row of signs, progressed to the right, went from right to left in the top row, and then left to right in the bottom row. A late epigram of Agathias recounts a game of tabula (generic Roman term for ""board game;"" backgammon in the Greek world is today known as tavli) that clearly describes a game of backgammon.",533,33,Murray 1951: 30-31,,1,1,"Duodecim Scripta, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum, Alea",,,,0,Eric Piette,,131066,"37°58'27.19""N, 23°43'37.42""E","3400,4199",0,,0,0

7,"20 Squares",,"20 Squares appears for the first time at the beginning of the second millennium BCE.

Two cuneiform tablets which attest to the rules of the game as played in Seleucid times have recently been translated. There has been some discussion over the ancient name of the game. The best argument is made by Wee (2018: 870) who identified the name as É Er-bé-et-ta, ""Room Four,"" which he also finds in other cuneiform tablets. Others have pointed to a Middle Kingdom Egyptian tomb painting at Beni Hasan which may show two men playing the game, accompanied by the caption ""iseb"" or ""aseb"" (Crist et al 2016: 85–87). Earlier scholars assumed that a game named ""Tjau"" mentioned in some Late Period Egyptian texts was this game (e.g., Peterson 1974: 853), but that has been rejected by more recent scholars (Pusch 2007: 84).",530,35,,Mesopotamia,1,1,"É Er-bé-et-ta, Iseb, Aseb, Game of Twenty, Twenty Squares, Room Four",,,,0,Eric Piette,"50",23211,"28°40'30.41""N, 57°44'13.74""E","1200,3499",0,,0,0

The game marketed two versions of it, under the name Around the World. One version, for the parlor, was played on a flat board; another, for the traveler, consisted of an actual dodecahedron. In both cases, nails at each vertex stood for a major city of the world and the player wrapped a piece of string around these nails as they went.

Stones enter unconnected, and can only move by fleeing from concentrations of enemy stones. Thus it is a movement game with a territorial aspect.  
    
The game includes capture-by-hopping moves, which create mutual-enemy stones as an intermediate stage before possible reconversion back to player's stones. This mechanism keeps the game provably finite. 
    
The pseudo-territories formed by the clumps of stones, have boundaries that can erode and shift; so the game is more tactical than strategic. Shifts in strategic concerns do occur, however, as the game evolves from first mainly claiming territory by placement density, to a race to agglomerate or capture, to fights to recapture vs blocking to retain lead in a tactical end game. 
    
Because the effect of the mutual-enemy stones on movement is symmetrical but not the same for the two players, the game requires considerable mental concentration.",1153,1153,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2557883"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

997,Hops-a-Daisy Generalized,,"Equi-based games are games played on a hex grid that share the following properties:
Each player has two kinds of pieces, one kind (Discs) move using steps and/or hops with flip-captures, the other kind (Hexes) are stationary. The stationary pieces have more score value, and they are limited to certain sites of placement. Identifying the placement sites for the stationary Hex pieces is based on their having an equal number of influencing neighbor pieces belonging to the player and to his (selected) enemy.

Turns consist of either: placing any a piece, or moving a Disc. The Disc move may be followed by optionally placing a Hex piece. The game ends when in succession, none of the players adds a piece to the board. The winner is the player who has the highest score, with the first player not to place a piece winning in the case of a tiebreaker. 

In the original game of Equi, The influencing neighbor pieces were found along lines of sight, and included only those pieces that were at the same distance as the nearest of them. The original game also had special placement limitations not discussed here, to reduce cycling. These evolved into produce the version cited here.

Areas of variation. The main families are: 
1. Equi - Line of sight based rules, forced flip-hopping of enemy pieces, and optional friendly hops, piece values same magnitude, but opposite sign. Details are that moving Disc pieces can only be entered onto non-Equi sites and not to suicide sites. The game is intended as a 2 player strategy game.

Equiversi - intended to be easier to play and more territorial and have less cycling issues.
The first change was to replace line of sight influence with adjacent piece influence, that is easier to see. With the increase in hex placement opportunities thus available, friendly hops were disallowed.

Then a second evolution, Equiversi-2, occurred with the concept of allowing players to decide a range of piece values for the Discs prior to play, -- represented here only by the selection of a zero value. Reduced value allowed for a relaxation of all placement restrictions on the Discs. An implementation side effect is that selecting a site gives a piece-choice pop-up for those sites where Hexes may be played. Pre-selecting the piece to play would be a better implementation.

Evolution to Hops-a-Daisy            
Nothing in the game prohibits a multi-player implementation, except that king-making could be an issue. Thus the idea of a small, light multi-player game based on Equi was born. To increase the chaotic experience, the hop changes both piece type and ownership leading to entirely different strategies. 

Hops-a-Daisy default rules allow hopping any piece, 'morphing' it (changing its type). Opponent's pieces are flipped to the mover's ownership as well. For ease of play, Disc placement is either to Non-Hex sites or unlimited. Hex placement considers all opponents as enemies. These settings can be changed to restrict hopping and/or Hex placement rules to either the preceding or following player's pieces. The game is strictly for fun and thus should be played on a small board.

These games also inspired Refugia, with different placement restrictions, single piece types, and ownership changes taking place in stages, which has been implemented separately on Ludii.",1159,1159,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,"2020-12-26",0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

1066,Throngs,,"Throngs a highly abstracted wargame (territorial invasion game) for two players. It is typically played on the intersections of a triangular grid, using Go stones. It is a double-move game: each player takes 2 full turns in succession before the next player takes control. 
            
            Movement: The game is distinguished by the way the power of a moving piece is determined according to the pieces around it: A piece can move as far as the difference in count of the friends and enemies in its immediate vicinity. 
            
            Removing an enemy and adding one's own piece take one power unit each. Remaining power goes into a series of steps or hops that may change direction at empty locations. 
            
            Strategy: Power to travel up to seven units per move can be developed during the game. As the offensive capacity develops, defensive measures are needed, first starting with limiting the mobility of enemy stones by approaching them, then by building walls, and thickening them along the axes of the opponent's catapulting sites (empty locations surrounded by many of that player's own stones.) These sites allow adding a stone and catapulting it up to a distance of 5, and are re-useable. In addition to these methods, defense is by scattering stones behind one's own lines to immobilise enemy stones that invade.
            
            The majority of turns naturally involve placement as well as movement, due to the benefit of gaining material; even though newly placed stones travel a reduced distance due to the cost of their placement. Occasional moves without placement are used mainly to initiate difficult invasions, as they risk simultaneously opening up positional weaknesses.  
            
            Individual stones may be captured by replacement when they are sufficiently out-numbered at a location, which means that towards the end of the game, chains of stones not anchored to a triangle, loop, or board edge will be consumed one-by-one by captures. Thus the shape and nature of territorial walls is worth contesting.
            
            Boards: The standard board is centerless, designed to allow maximal distance moves from the center, while minimizing the size of the board. The hexagonal corner regions help to stabilize invasions in outlying areas. The reverse angles along the edge are slightly less defensible than the other parts, breaking the edges into stategic zones.
            
            The game is easily adapted not only to to different size and shape boards, but also to different grid topologies, while remaining interesting and playable. A 'perforated' grid is included to demonstrate this, but there are many other possibilities as well. 
            
            The center of the board is very advantageous, and a pie rule or balanced starting positions are needed. The standard starting position places the initial pieces near the edges to allow players a wider variety of strategies. Placing multiple starting stones, and or playing on torus boards, leads to finer grained, denser, highly tactical games, while using few starting pieces and larger boards or boards with less connectivity (e.g. boards with holes, and boards on semi-regular grids) lead to a more territorial game.
            
            Play on a torus also eliminates the advantage of a board center, but requires a larger board because invasion is no longer from a single direction.",1224,1224,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2452882/throngs-new-attempt-describe-how-play"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG Forum</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

This game was the winner of the second Annual Game Design Competition in 2002, whose theme that year was the design of games of unequal forces (organized by Abstract Games magazine, About Board Games, and the Strategy Gaming Society). The name came from a symmetric ancestor game called 'Lur'. When the game was supported on Ludoteka, the Edge rule was added because placing on the edge is usually bad for Black. More information about the origins of the game can be found in Spanish on the designer's blog:

1167,Goats Wintering,,"'Goats Wintering' gives the impression of goats gathering into herds in a sheltered area as winter approaches. 
The goal is to maximize the connections between the goats. However, goats may not be placed too close to others of their kind along sight-lines. So there is tension in who can place and move their goats together most efficiently.

The novel movement mechanism is that a goat's movement is restricted to steps that increase its friendly contact, -- or, when increasing friendly contact is not avaiable to it, steps that decrease its contact with competing goats.

When goats get close enough to others of their kind, they can then thus move to join a flock and increase the connections. But frequently they will need the presence of the opponent's goats to be able to get this close to their own flocks. This is because goats allow movement choices for any goats near them: isolated goats can't move. So, the tension is in finding places to enter one's goats that are at a suitable range to gather them together.

There is capture: Moves that fully surround any of the opponents goats cause those goats to leave the play area. 
To prevent cycling, the subordinate kind of goat move is not allowed after a pass. This allows a player with a strong lead to pass until the other player runs out of moves and the game ends.

        
The game is inspired from Infuse by the same Author, but the clumping here is more open and pronounced and clumps are distance-limited, not line-of-sight limited. 

It may be played on either hex grids with adjacent movement, or square grids with ortho-diagonal diagonal movement.",1327,1327,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,"2020-11-19",0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

1377,Windflowers,,"Windflowers is a finite, 2-player, place-or-capture, connectivity game. 
    It is playable on a wide variety of grid and connectivity types.
    
    Placement is to empty sites: Capture is by replacing an opponent's stone during placement if the opponent owns more of the surrounding stones. Passing is allowed, and the game ends upon consecutive passes. The board typically is full at this point, but there might be capture options still available that are disadvantageous to take.
        
    Scoring is based on connectivity: The player with the fewer groups of stones wins. Ties are broken in favor of the owner of the largest non-tied group.
    
    Other scoring options include: Option 2: The size of the largest group, possibly with bonus points for each separate group that belongs to Option 3:, yourself; or  Option 4: your opponent.
    
    Of special interest is the way in which the threat of capture encourages early piece placement out-of-contact with one's own stones preventing large solid groupings of stones, and how it may be safely deferred until later when the capture may have more impact.  The actual number of captures in a game tend to be few and toward the end, and they play a disproportionate role in determining the winner.",1549,1549,,,0,1,"",Dale W. Walton,,"2021-05-25",0,Dale W.

1411,Morpharaoh,,"The title of the game Morpharaoh is a nod to capture (morph), connection (a row), a previous square grid connection game by Luis Bolaños Mures' Morphos which inspired it, and to the Cairo tiling used for the board.
  
  The game solves the cross-cut problem of boards with cells that meet 4-to-a-vertex in some locations, by use of a capture based on a majority n of adjacencies, thus preventing immediate recapture. To minimise the amount of captures, and thus provide the a more strategic game than one based on simple majority captures, the captures are limited to those that resolve crosscuts along an existing diagonal connection, using a lobsided 'V' pattern of surrounding stones. -- and restricting edge capture to captures adjacent to an adjacent pair of stones. 
  
  Option is provided for independently relaxing these restrictions.
  A pie offer option has not yet been implemented.  
  
  The boards provided are a 48 cell and 160 cell board, designed specifically to provide an odd number of neighbors to each cell: 5 in the interior, and 3 at every edge cell. The Cairo board is one of the few regualr grids that permit such a condition. It also dilutes the possible cross-cuts to two per location, compared with 4 per location on a square grid.",1585,1585,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2693572"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

1434,Sprout-R-Out,,"Sprout-R-Out is a newly invented territorial game for Cairo and limping Hex boards based on an original placement protocol: 
            Players place one stone next to each opponent's group, but without touching any other group. Any group that cannot be played beside is removed.
            
            This creates an capture dynamic superficially like Go where groups get overgrown and die.  Unlike Go, a single, isolated eye, once formed, is enough to give life.
            
            On the other hand, even multiple larger eyes can be insufficient for life, because the timing of capture and the requirement to play against every opponent's group if possible, can leave multiple eyes filled with uncaptured stones.
            
            The feeling of the game definitely not like Go. The game is more tactical because placements are constrained to be adjacent to existing pieces, and multiple pieces are played per turn. 
            
            Spreading pieces out to quickly surround the opponent during your turn can easily backfire, as it leads to more opponent placements and fewer locations needed by the opponent to surround your pieces.",1649,1649,"Dale W.
