Meantime, although the fight rages fiercely now the hostile ranks are split, yet thou thyself art victorious with serried line unbroken, or despoiled may be of one or two men, and both thy hands rattle with the prisoned throng."\r\n\r\nTranslation from Austin 1934: 30.', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

', 'Played by the Penihing people in Borneo as documented by Carl Lumholtz: "The Penihings have a game called ot-tjin which I also observed in other Bornean tribes, and which to some extent is practiced by the Malays...With the Penihings the complete name is aw-li on-nam ot-tjin, meaning: play on-nam fish. An essential of the game is an oblong block of heavy wood which on its upper surface is provided with two rows of shallow holes, ten in each row, also a larger one on each end. The implement is called tu-tung ot-jin, as is also both of the single holes at the ends. There are two players who sit opposite each other, each controlling ten holes. The stake may be ten or twenty wristlets, or perhaps a fowl, or the black rings that are tied about the upper part of the calf of the leg, but not money, because usually there is none about. The game is played in the evenings. Two, three, four, or five stones of a small fruit may be put in each hole; I noticed they generally had three; pebbles may be used instead. Let us suppose two have been placed in each hole; the first player takes up two from any hole on his side. He then deposits one in the hole next following. Thus we have three in each of these two holes. He takes all three from the last hole and deposits one in each of the next three holes; from the last hole  he again takes all three, depositing one in each of the next three holes. His endeavour is to get two stones in a hole and thus make a "fish." He proceeds until he reaches an empty hole, when a situation has arisen which is called a gok—that is to say, he must stop, leaving his stone there. His adversary now begins on his side wherever he likes, proceeding in the same way, from right to left, until he reaches an empty hole, which makes him gok, and he has to stop. To bring together two stones in one hole makes a "fish," but if three stones were originally placed in each hole, then they make a "fish"; if four were originally placed, thenb four make a "fish," etc., up to five. The player deposits the "fish" he gains to the right in the single hole at the end. The two men proceed alternately in this manner, trying to make a "fish" (ára ot-tjin). The player is stopped in his quest by an empty hole; there he deposits his last stone and his adversary begins. During the process of taking up and laying down the stones no hole is omitted, in some of them the stones will accumulate. On the occasion of the game i described I saw two with eight in them. When one of the players has no stones left in his holes he has lost. If stones are left on either side, then there is an impasse, and the game must be played over again."\r\n\r\nThe drawing accompanying the description is of a board with 2x9 holes with one larger on either end.

', '"No account of the pastimes of the Ibos would be complete without a description of the of the game of okwe. Probbaly this remark applies to the whole of West Africa, as the game is almost, if not quite, universal. It is a recreation more in favour with the elder folk, the old man being particularly partial to it. \r\n\r\nIn order to play the game counters and a properly prepared board are necessary. The board (ubaw-okwe) has two parallel rows of holes. The number of holes varies from ten to twenty per side and the boards are often nicely carved. Some of them are black and polished with long usage and are treasured as heirlooms. The players may be two, three, or four, the opponents facing each other on opposite sides of the board. It is impossible, without taking up a huge amount of space, to write full directions for playing the game. Briefly, the procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\nWorking always from left to right on the board the counters are distributed thus:-\r\n5 counters in each of the first 7 holes. on both sides.\r\n1 counter in each of the next 2 holes, on both sides.\r\n5 counters in the tenth hole on both sides.\r\n1 counter in the eleventh hole on both sides.\r\nThe challenger always concedes first move.\r\n\r\nPlayer No. 1 immediately appropriates (lit: "eats") all the counters in holes 8, 9, 10, and 11, as a sort of nucleus for his working capital.\r\n\r\nPlayer No. 2 likewise appropriates a number, but in his case leaves the single counter in hole eleven, i.e. No. 1 is one counter to the good from the start. \r\n\r\nPlayers begin where they like on the board but must take all-save one- of the counters from the holes selected, and these must be distributed singly along the row of holes until they are exhausted. The object is so to place the counters that the last one drops opposite a hole in which the opponent has one or three counters. If a player can do this he "eats" the one or three, i.e. he appropriates them. The object is to force one''s opponent to move out his counters in such a way that he cannot save himself from the one and three traps. As soon as a player wishes he can replace his playing counters be redistributing his own working capital, but to do this he must drop in the counters singly, one for each hole, and if a surplus remains after passing down all the hole of the board then the process is repeated until all the "eaten" counters are once more in the game."

', '"KIKUYU, GIUTHI. Among the Kikuyu giuthi is played primarily by young boys when they are herding cattle of goats. Since the game is played on a very casual basis, holes dug in the ground are the most common form of board. Wooden boards are practically nonexistent. Small\r\nstones are used as counters, or sometimes the seeds of the mubuthi tree. The board consists of two rows with anywhere from five to ten pits in each. Two-by-eight is preferred. The number\r\nof stones in each pit varies from four to nine; six is preferred. At present, knowledge of the game is being lost among the Kikuyu. Even those who can play it, often make mistakes in the\r\nrules and have to reminded by a bystander who happens to remember. One of them said, “If you haven’t been herding you don’t know the game.” And many of the boys today have not\r\nbeen herding. There were special names for various pits and for certain moves, but no ones eems to know them now...\r\n\r\nThe player to start the game is decided as follows: One player takes a stone or seed and hides it in one of his hands behind his back so that his opponent does not know which hand the stone\r\nis in. He may place a small wad of mud in the other hand. The two hands are then brought forward and the opponent must guess which hand holds the stone. If he guesses correctly, he\r\nbegins the game. (I wonder if this practice was introduced by Europeans as it appears to be unique.)\r\nTo make a move, a player picks up the entire contents of any one pit on his own side and sows\r\nthe stones, one in each succeeding pit, in either direction. When a handful ends, he picks up the entire contents of that pit and sows them in the opposite direction. Each time he picks up a\r\nnew handful, he changes direction. This complete lack of a mandatory direction is unique to giuthi. One is not permitted to start with a single stone.\r\nA move is not considered valid until the player has crossed the border over into the other side of the board. If he lands in an empty pit before this he gets another turn. If, after having crossed\r\nthe border, he ends in an empty pit on his own side, and the pit opposite contains one or more\r\nstones, these stones are captured. The stone making the capture is also taken off. Captured\r\nstones are put in some safe place off the board. If the pit making the capture is followed by a\r\nstring of one or more empty pits each of which has at lest one stone in its opposing pit, these\r\nare also captured. The move is over after all captures are completed and it is the opponent’s\r\nturn. In any case, the move is over once a player has landed in an empty pit on either side after\r\nhaving crossed the border at least once.\r\nIf a player cannot make a move because he has only single stones in any of his pits, he loses\r\nhis turn until such time as he has more. If, at any time, he has none, that game is over. The\r\nstones left on the opponent’s side belong to the opponent. The winner is the one with the most\r\nstones.\r\nAs with the Maasai, it is common practice to continue the game into a second phase. One\r\nproceeds like this: The person with the less beads replaces them on the board in any\r\narrangement he chooses. Much experience is required to take maximum advantage of this\r\nopportunity. Some versions of the game do not require one to replace all the seeds that one\r\nhas on the board. In addition, if the loser of the first game has less than half of his original\r\nnumber of seeds, he may ask that the board be shortened by two pits in each row, to a\r\nminimum of three. His opponent, the one with the most seeds, places an equal number of\r\nseeds in each pit on his side opposite to the ones placed by the loser. Some versions require\r\nthat the winner place double the number in each of his pits, if the loser has less than half. The game then continues as before until one player cannot continue. The second game is begun by\r\nthe loser; after that the two take turns." Driedger 1972.', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

At either end there may be two larger hollowed recesses which are used as receptacles for the counters. There are an equal even number of holes in each of the four rows. but there may be any number of holes from six to twenty-eight in a row, the usual number being between sixteen and twenty. Sometimes, instead of on a board, the game is played in little holes scooped out in the ground. There are two players, each man commanding two rows. Each starts by putting two stones or pips into each hole in his own two rows, except the left-hand hole of the front row, which is empty, and the adjoining hole into which he only puts one. The game represents a cattle raid and the stones are the cattle. The player who first removes all his opponent''s stones is the winner. Some of the ejaculations, used to describe moves and positions, appear to be archaic words, and could not be explained by the players. \r\n\r\nMethod of Play\r\n\r\n1. The moves are made anti-clockwise, and there is a regular opening move which is always followed. \r\n2. Stones are picked up from one hole and placed one in each following hole. If, however, the last stone does not fall in a vacant hole, the pile is picked ip and the stones again dropped, one at a time, in the following holes. This is repeated until eventually one stone ends in a vacant hole. A single move may entail many movements of stones around the two rows before a vacant hole is obtained.\r\n3. When the counter finally comes to rest in a vacant hole in the front row the player shouts "Thuku!" a hit (onomatopoeic, implying that the shot has hit the mark). After achieving a thuku, the player removes all the stones in the hole immediately opposite and the hole behind it on his opponent''s side; if there are no counters in the hole immediately opposite, he may not remove those behind and no hit is scored.\r\n4. After scoring a thuku, the player is entitled to a forfeit, the thuro. He may take the contents of any hole on the opponent''s side as his thuro. This ends the move, and the next player has a turn. \r\n5. As long as any hole contains two or more counters no single stones may be removed. ...\r\n\r\nIt is tabu to play this game after sunset, for fear that, by playing at cattle raiding after dark, a real raid might be provoked.

They then take one counters from each of the holes in the inner row and redistribute them into the outer row, one in each hole. Then, each player sows counters in an anti-clockwise direction beginning from the rightmost hole in the inner row, proceeding, picking up the contents of holes when the last counter falls into an occupied hole and continuing sowing. However, the final counter that would fall into the rightmost hole in the outer row (which should now contain 17 coutners) is not placed there, but rather on the second to right hole in the inner row, which should now contain one counter. \r\n\r\nInitial phase:\r\nIn the initial phase, the rightmost hole in the inner and outer row for each player are out of play. All sowing and capturing only occurs on the remaining holes. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. When it falls into an occupied hole in the player''s inner row and the opponent''s opposite holes in the inner and outer row are occupied, these are taken. These are then sown in the player''s holes beginning with the next hole after the one making the capture. If the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole that cannot make a capture, then the counters in this hole are picked up and sowing continues. \r\n\r\nSecond phase: The initial phase ends when a player plays from the rightmost hole in the outer row. This can be by necessity or by choice. Once this happens, that player must play in all of their holes. The opponent may remain in the initial phase after this point until they play from their rightmost hole. The same sowing and capturing rules as before.\r\n\r\nPlay continues until one player can no longer move. ', '"En position initiale, les pions sont répartis à raison de edux par case (cette distribution est uniforme dans tous les solo, elle permet aux joueurs de vérifier le nombre des pions). \r\nDans la première partie, le trait est adjugé par tirage au sort ou, plus souvent, par accord entre les joueurs. Pour les parties suivantes, l''usage est de joueur à tour de rôle. \r\nPour effectuer un coup, le joueur choisit dans son camp un liha, c''est-à-dire une case qui contient au moins deux pions. Les singletons, donc, ne sont pas jouables –ce que les Sukuma expriment par <<les mâles (ngosha) ne sont pas productifs>>. Ensuite, le joueur prend les pions de cette case de départ et les sème un par un dans les cases suivantes,  en respectant la direction obligatoire.\r\n\r\nSi la dernière graine de son semis tombe dans une case occupée en face de laquelle aucune prise n''est possible, il ramasse tous les pions qui s''y trouvent et enchaîne un nouveau semis. Il peut effectuer une prise si la dernière grain de son semis tombe dans une case occupée de sa rangée interne faisant face aux deux cases adverses de la même colonne.\r\n\r\nDans ce cas, le joueur prend le contenu de ces deux cases adverses et le transfère dans son camp, pour enchaîner un nouveau semis à partir de la case de départ de son précédent semis. En un seul coup, il est donc possible de faire plusieurs captures. On peut également procéder à un très long safari en enchaînant des semis sans gain (kutagata). Le coup se termine lorsque le dernier pion d''un semis tombe dans une case vide: le joueur qui vient de <<mourir>> (kucha) passe la main à son adversaire. \r\n\r\nGagne celui qui parvient à immobiliser son adversaire, ce qui se produit lorsque ce dernier n''a que des singletons ou même (très rarement) plus de pions du tout.\r\n\r\nJeu de garçons, Position initiale:\r\n\r\nPour obtenir cette disposition, le protocole ludique exige que l''on procède de la manière suivante: on commence par la position de contrôle (deux pions par case); puis, chacun des joueurs ramasse tous les ions de sa rangée externe et les dépose dans sa case H/h; les pions sont alors placés comme indiqué par la figure 6. Les joueurs prennent ensuite un pion de chaque case de la rangée interne et les déposent dans la case symétrique de la rangé externe. Après quoi, chacun des joueurs prend le pion de la case I/i, le dépose dans la case J/j, récupère les 2 pions de celle-ci et les sème; parvenu à la case L/l, il enchaîne pour arriver en N/n, et ainsi de suite jusqu''à ce qu''il ait atteint H/h. A l''issue de cette manoeuvre, cette dernière case contient 18 pions. Pour obtenir la position initiale de cette variante, il suffit d''ôter un pion de H/h et de le déposer en J/j.\r\n\r\nPendant la phase d''ouverture, les cases H et h, qui contiennent chacune 17 pions, sont des ng''hana (cases privilégiées): tant que leur propriétaire ne les a pas entamées, elles sont imprenable et, de ce fait, les cases I/i se trouvent protégées (de même, réciproquement, I/i protègent H/h). Ces quatre cases, le temps d''ouverturee, sont exclues des circuits de déplacement des pions, si bien que chacun évolue dans un camp rétréci.\r\n\r\nLa durée de la phase d''ouverture est déterminée par la maintien des ng''hana: elle est donc différente pour chaque partenaire. Ainsi lorsque Sud décide ou est contraint de redistribuer les pions de cette case, la phase d''ouverture est close pour lui, il n''a plus de cases privilégiées et son camp recouvre ses dimensions normales.

Upon reaching the final hole in the opponent''s row, play continues with the first hole in the player''s own row. In the first phase, Players take counters from the leftmost hole in their row and sow them in the appropriate direction. When the final counter lands in a hole with counters, they are picked up and sowing continues until the last counter is dropped into an empty hole. \r\n\r\nPlay continues in phase two in the same manner as before, but the players take turns and the player who "won" the first phase plays first. Players capture counters when placing the last counter of a sowing into one of their own holes which is empty. If the hole is on the left half of the board, any counters in the two holes of the opponent facing it are captured. If the last hole is on the right half of the board, any counters in the opponent''s one hole facing it are captured. The player then continues to move using the last counter placed which effected the capture, and placing it in the next hole. This move can result in further captures (if the hole is empty), continuation of sowing (if there are counters in it), or the end of the turn (if hole is empty and there are no opponent''s counters to be captured). \r\n\r\nPlay continues until a player has no counters in their holes.

The player with fewer counters distributes all of their counters on the board, even if they cannot place three in the final hole of the counting. The player with more counters then places three counters in the same number of holes as the other player, taking any remaining as their winnings. \r\n\r\nPlay continues in this fashion until one player captures all of the counters. \r\n\r\n', '"Gabata in the central highlands of Eritrea is played by males and females on boards, or in holes in the ground, particularly in the period of marriages, the latter taking place largely after the harvest season, i.e., between November and January. During the weeks after the marriage the young people associated with the event spend many hours playing gabata, but it would be unusual, at least in public, for the newly married husband and wife to play together, for to do so might appear too intimate or familiar. \r\n\r\nThis highland game was played for the present writer by Abba Pawlos Tzadua of Serae and his colleagues Abba Zacharias of Akala Guzay both of the Catholic Cathedral in Addis Ababa, as wel as by several Eritrean students at Haile Sellassie I University, notably by Michael Yaqob of Akala Guzay and Gabra Sellasé Gabra Amlak of Serae, to all of whom, as to the other players mentioned later, the warmest thanks are due.\r\n\r\nThis game, often referred to in Tigrinya as abalala''e, or "eating," is probably the game msot widely played in the highlands of Eritrea. It is played by two players on a three-row board of sixteen holes, half of which are considered to belong to each player. Each player owns the whole of the row nearest to him and half of the central row to the right. \r\n\r\nAt the outset of the game three balls or counters are placed in each of the eighteen holes.Play then begins, by the two players moving simultaneously—more or less it should be noted, as in Ethiopian chess, or santaraj—with a view of racing each other to an empty hole. Each player would thus start by picking up the entire contents of the left-hand hole in his nearest row (i.e., PLayer A in hole 1 and Player B in hole 10), and would then distribute them one by one in the ensuing holes to their right. On dropping the last of his balls in his or her hand into any hole each player would pick up the entire contents of that hole, and distribute them in turn in the ensuing holes. He would thus move from left to right across his own row, from right to left along his half of the middle row, from right to left across his opponent''s principal row, and finally from left to right along his opponent''s half of the middle row. Having thus traversed all eighteen holes he would start again in his left-hand corner hole, and proceed as before, unless of course he has already stopped at an empty hole. Such hole was called kwah in Tigrinya, an onomatopoeic word symbolising the sound of the ball alighting on the board.\r\n\r\nThe first player to come to a halt at this stage of the game would be the first to move, and thereafter—there is again a parallel with santaraj—the players would move alternately in accordance with the following rules.\r\n\r\nEach player would always start in one of his own holes by picking up its entire contents. Following the above specified direction of play he would then distribute the ball or balls he had in his hand one by one into the ensuing hole or holes, which, because of the previous play, now had an unequal number \r\nof counters in them. Should the last ball in his hand alight on an empty hole his move would come to an end, but if the last ball landed on an occupied hole he would pick up its contents and continue in this way until finally alighting on an empty hole. On thus stopping in an empty hole the player could under certain circumstances take, in Tigrinya balé, or "eat" the contents, of one or more of his opponent''s opposite holes.\r\n\r\nThe rules for such captures are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A player stopping in an empty hole is any of the three holes to his left, i.e., facing two rows of his opponent, would capture the contents, if any of the opposite holes in both rows of his opponent.\r\n\r\n2. A player stopping in an empty hole in any of the six holes in the two rows on his right, i.e., facing a single row of his opponent, would capture the contents, if any, of the opposite hole in that single row, irrespective of whether he landed in the first or second row. \r\n\r\nAfter making such a capture or captures the player would continue his move by picking up the counter with which he had effected this gambit, and would place it in the ensuing hole. This latter gambit, depending on circumstances, would result in one of the following three situations:\r\n\r\n(a) the capture of a further ball or balls, if the counter again fell into one of the player''s empty holes facing an occupied hole or holes on his opponent''s opposite row or rows.\r\n\r\n(b) continuation of the move if the counter fell on an occupied hole, the contents of which the player would then pick up and redistribute.\r\n\r\n(c) end of the move if the counter landed in an empty hole (kwah) from which a capture could not be effected, i.e., because the opposite hole or holes on the opponent''s opposite row or rows were empty, or because the hole in which the counter stopped was itself on the opponent''s side. \r\n\r\nPlayers were entitled to count balls and holes in order to estimate how best to play. A player wishing to cancel and repeat a move, on account for example of a miscalculation, would say in Tigrinya aygushetoyn, i.e., literally "I must change," but a player could prevent this by saying "gushetoka," i.e., "you must not change."\r\n\r\nPlay would continue until one player''s side of the board was entirely empty and its owner was therefore unable to move. The other player would then appropriate the remaining balls, i.e., those in his holes, and add them to his previous takings.\r\n\r\nThe two players would then count out their winnings by placing the balls they had taken, three by three, into the holes on their own side, and would do this by following the routine order of play, i.e., left to right in the first row and right to left in the middle row. If the two player''s takings were not equal the weaker player would fill as many holes as he could, being allowed to occupy the last hole with two or even one ball if he did not have the requisite three. His opponent would fill the corresponding holes on his own side with an identical number of balls to those deployed by the first player and would put the remainder aside as his winnings. Part of the central part of the board would thus be left unoccupied but the holes in that area are continued to belong to their original owners, and were played over in exactly the same manner as before.\r\n\r\nPlay would continue, round by round, until one or other player had captured all the balls, and thus driven his opponent from the field."

Each player has fifty beans, which he places ten to each of his five playing-holes. The play commences when the first player, selecting any hole on his side of the board, takes out nine of the beans, leaving one in the hole from which he played, and dis- tributes them, one to a playing-hole, moving around the board in a counter-clockwise direction until the beans in his hand are exhausted. His opponent then selects a hole on his side (in which there will now be eleven beans) and does the same. In the first ten moves of the game, all of the ten playing-holes must be emptied, and it is only after these more or less formal moves, which get the game under way, have been played that the essential tactics can show themselves.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to reduce one''s opponent to a position where it is impossible for him to move. To this end, beans are captured in the following manner: if, after distributing the beans which have been in a given hole the final bean falls into a hole (the native term being kaba, " to end ") which precedes another hole containing 1, 3, or 5 beans, or any sequential combination of ones, threes or fives, he captures these beans and places them in his bot-the hole at his right hand. The only exception to this rule is the opening move of the game, since the final bean must fall in the hole preceding the one where play was started. This bean cannot be captured. It makes no difference whether the captured beans be in holes on the player''s side of the board, or on his opponent''s, he must take if. he ends before a hole having 1, 3, or 5 beans.\r\nWhen beans are distributed from a hole, one must be left, nor may a hole containing only one bean be played. Empty holes can only result from a capture.Therefore, when the play has reduced the number of beans, and the holes of one''s opponent contain no beans or only one apiece, he is unable to move in his turn, and the game is lost. There is a way, however, in which the game may be tied: after .one player can no longer move, he redistributes the beans in his boto, that is, the ones he has captured in the course of the game, into the holes on his side.

If there be now no other vacant station between the attacking piece just moved and the enemy''s piece along that line, these, whatever their number, are captured at once, as far as they stand in unbroken order on the line attacked. If, however, a vacant position occurs in their line, or another hostile piece is among them, then only the piece or pieces nearest the assailant are captured.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The pieces of the enemy may be captured by a retreat as well as by an advance. A piece that has been standing in an adjoining station to some piece or pieces of the enemy may capture it or them by retreating one point along that line, if such point happens to be vacant. The limitation defined immediately above applies in this case also.\r\n\r\nFourthly. At the beginning of a game one move only is permitted to the first side. After that side has moved once, any piece that is moved is permitted to run amuck in the enemy''s lines, and to go on as long as he finds foes to capture, provided (a) that he does not return immediately to any point he has just left, and (b) that he does not take a foe behind him immediately after taking one in front of him, nor one on his right hand immediately after taking on his left hand, and vice versa.

The mode of play is, however, radically different, the method of capturing in particular having more in common, s we shall see, with the games of central Ethiopia. The game is, however, played by basically the same cross-sections of the population as further north, and is similarly often a pastime during the celebrations after marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Adowa Area\r\n\r\nThe gabata of the Adowa area here described was played by two Haile Sellassie I University students, Alamayehu Gabra Heywat of Maymesham and Haylu Belay of the Gabriel quarter of the city. \r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the board and direction of plat is the same as in the three-row gabata of the highlands of Eritrea. Normally the game would be played by two players, but three could also play, in which case one would own the whole of one row of six holes, while the two other players would each be allotted two rows of three holes on either side of the board.\r\n\r\nPlayers would move alternately (or in the case of three players consecutively) , without racing as in the highlands of Eritrea. The first plater would begin any-where on his side of the board by picking up the entire contents of any of his holes and would then drop the balls one by one in the ensuing holes, picking up the contents of the hole in which the last ball fell, and proceeding in this manner until he reached an empty hole after which he would stop, it being then his opponent''s turn to move.\r\n\r\nEAch player, who could start a move only from one of his own  holes, would have as his objective the capture of a hole on his opponent''s side, preferably the latter''s extreme left hole, known as ayni eda or "eye of the house." (If the game was played by three players each would try to capture the hole immediately after his own block of holes in the direction of play.)\r\n\r\nThe process of capturing, or wagika, the word employed for piercing with a spear, was effected by dropping the last ball in any hand into one of the opponent''s holes containing three balls, which were thus increased to four. (This method of capture, as we shall see, is characteristic of several of the games further south). Such a hole was referred to as wegue, but could not be captured until the original clusters of three balls in each hole had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nA player could under no circumstances pick up the contents of a wegue he had captured, but could tax or "eat" mebelae, from s wegue belonging to his opponent, in which case he would put aside two balls, the last in his hand and one from the wegue, as his takings. Should the wegue become empty the opponent landing there with the last ball in his hand would pit aside only that ball, i.e., not two as previously, but whenever the holle filled again the previous method of "eating" involving two balls would be resumed. A player capturing a wegue continued his move, doing so  by moving the contents of any of the holes on his side. The prolongation of the move was known as belu''eka sini, or "escorting." There was (unlike in some other types of gabata) no limitation on the number of wegue a player could capture, and the two players (or in the case of three players, all three)could simultaneously own such holes, for a wegue once captured could not be lost in that round.\r\n\r\nA player unable to move on account of lack of counters on his side (always excluding wegue holes from which he could not in any case pick up balls) would lose the right to play, but could do so again whenever in the course of play one or more balls returned to any of his usable holes.\r\n\r\nThe round would come to an end when all the balls had been either captured and put aside or had accumulated in one or more wegue. The players would then count out their total takings i.e., those removed from the board or accumulated in wegue, by putting them back in their holes three by three. A player winning two or more than his original complement of counters would capture holes from his opponent, one hole for every three balls captured, and would take these from his opponent''s left-hand holes. Whenever a player found himself with an extra two counters, he would gain a complete hole, for his opponent, with one extra counter, would surrender the latter to him. \r\n\r\nIf towards the end of the game a player was reduced to one hole which was subsequently captured as a wegue the capturer would pick up three of the four balls as his takings, thus leaving the other player one counters with which to continue to move. \r\n\r\nThe game would be won when one or other player captured all the holes and thus became the victor."

It consists of four rows of ten holes and, according to the museum information, was brought in by World War I soldiers as a souvenir. With the assistance of the senior curator Ms Bella Rose and assistant senior Curator Miss Jeanne Pothin, the following players were located near the capital Mah ́e.\r\nOn March 22, 2007, Barry Marengo (1933–) was invited to the museum and illustrated the game using the museum board. He confirmed that the name was Makonn and that the configuration had always been four by ten holes. He played with stones, although cowry shells are also known to be used, that were placed one by one in each hole and he spread the stones in anti-clockwise direction. Singles were not allowed to be played unless the player had singles only. He had learned the game at age fourteen and used to play in a group of circa eight players.\r\nTwo days later a visit was paid to Robin Pierre Marie (1934–) who owns a lakanbiz or baka-bar in Pointe La Rue, south of Mah ́e. In his bar there was one Makonn board, a ten by ten draughts board and another board game similar to draughts and known as Damn la tete. On arrival players were involved in playing Makonn.\r\nMr Marie started his bar in 1989 and used a self-made board for play. The players in the bar were mostly taught by the owner although in former days other players, already familiar with the game, had also joined. He started playing the game at age sixteen and also played in Diego Garcia from 1959 onwards with other men from the Seychelles and Mauritius. He later played in Desroches, part of the Amirantes archipelago and Aldabra. In 1988 he left Desroches and returned to Mah ́e where he had resided since he was nine. He was originally brought up on the island of La Digue.\r\nThe game was not known to him with any configuration other than four rows of ten holes. Since the game is associated with drinking baka, women do not commonly play with men but they are known to play the game in separate areas. Both Mr Marie and Mr Marengo were not familiar with any competition or tournament play for this game.\r\nThe National Sports Council produced a document in which the game of Makonn is described but the rules cannot be inferred from this description [3]. The following rules were obtained after observing, playing and asking questions about the game of Makonn in Pointe La Rue.\r\n\r\nThe Makonn rules\r\n\r\nMakonn is played on a board with four rows of eight holes. It needs forty counters, usually stones or shells. Each player owns two rows of eight holes that are closest to the player as well as the counters in those rows. The object of the game is to capture all counters of the opponent.\r\n\r\nThe game can be divided in three stages.\r\n\r\nThe opening\r\n\r\nThe game starts with one counter in each hole. One player begins by rear- ranging the counters in the two rows owned by that player. The player may rearrange these counters in any way as long as they remain on the board and on the player’s side of the board. One counter may be placed in order to capture the opposite occupied holes of the opponent (for capture moves, see middle game).\r\nOnce ready, the other player may rearrange the other part of the board and, if possible, also place a counter to capture the content of the opposite hole(s).\r\n\r\nThe middle game\r\n\r\nOnce the counters have been arranged, the first player starts a move by picking up the contents of a hole on the player’s side that contains more than one counter. These counters are placed one-by-one in consecutive holes in counter-clockwise direction within the player’s own two rows. When the last counter of such a sowing reaches an occupied hole, that hole is emptied and the contents are sowed starting in the next hole and in the same way and direction. This continues until the last counter of a sowing ends in an empty hole.\r\nWhen the last counter ends in an empty hole the move ends or the player makes a capture. The player can only capture if this empty hole is directly adjacent to an occupied hole of the opponent. The complete contents of the opponent’s hole and, if present, the contents of the hole directly behind this hole in the back row of the opponent, are captured and taken from the board.\r\nThis game continues until one player has nothing left and lost the game or when one player has only holes with single counters in which case this player enters the singles game.\r\n\r\nThe singles game\r\n\r\nIf a player has only single counters in the two rows of holes, this player is still allowed to play. The player may now move a single counter in the same way and direction, but only into an empty hole. It is not allowed to play a single into a hole that already contains a counter. Captures are made in the same way as in the middle game.\r\nSince the game starts with all holes containing a single counter, it is necessary that in the opening game at least one change is made to allow the players to make a move."', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Each player digs seven small holes in the ground in lines opposite each other and places five stones in each hole. Each player in turns picks up all the stones out of any hole on his side, and distributes them one by one counter-clockwise in the other holes beginning at the first hole on the right of the one from which he has taken the stones. Should the last stone end in a a hole which either contains one or three stones (not two), the player may take them and place them on one side; alkso, if the one immediately next to it on the right, in which a stone has been put., contains either one or three, it may also be taken.

As a preliminary, any two holes on one side and one hole on the other are left empty; in each of the other nine holes are placed eight cowry shells, which are termed "Dogs."

If this occur during the first two sowings round the board, in which no captures are made, the player stops, and the opponent begins to play; but on subsequent occasions he "eats" the Dogs in the opposite hole, whether on his own or his opponent''s side of the board, as in the Daramutu game. He then continues his play, moving into the next hole the last shell which he had just put down, and sowing the shells out of that one, and so on, until his last shell falls into an empty hole opposite which there are no Dogs to be eaten. The other player then commences, and plays in the same way.

These provinces are rather poor, and thus have a low population density and a strong emigration rate. They were observed in Neiba, Villa Jaragua, Los Ríos, Postrer Río, La Descubierta and Jimaní, but not in Barahona, the largest town in the area. Generally Hoyito is not played in the centre of bigger villages or along the main road even in smaller villages. It is more popular in the countryside, where it is played outdoor, either in the courtyard or near the river.\r\n\r\nHoyito was once enjoyed by everyone, though mostly by women. Today it is a children''s game, rarely played by adults who often view it in a depriciatory manner. It is considered a waste of time by many adults and sometimes children are punished for playing it. A woman reported that she was scolded as a girl for playing it because she didn''t do her homework, and another person said that children skipped school to play it. As a match takes a long time, players may change. Although there are no competitions, it is widely believed that girls are playing better than boys.\r\n\r\nSome older people still think that the game invites misfortune. One woman remembered that in old days it wasn''t allowed to dig holes on Good Friday, so the board was made on Holy Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game was played with seeds of bottle gourds (Crescentia cujete) known as mate seeds, but today pebbles have replaced them. The holes are either dug into the earth or drawn on concrete. There are no wooden boards. Sometimes the game is played for a little stake such as glass beads.\r\n\r\nToday Hoyito has lost much of its former popularity, although it could be argued that the game might be a useful tool to teach children mathematical skills.\r\n\r\nHoyito I is almost equal to Ba-awa, except that a four is captured by the one moving, not by the one owning the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules\r\nHoyito is played by two persons on a board, which consists of two rows of six holes called casitas ("little houses"). Sizes up to 2x12 were also recorded, but are far less common.\r\n\r\nInitially each hole contains four counters.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial Position\r\n\r\nOn his turn a player picks up the contents from one of his holes and then distributes them, one by one, into the following holes in a counterclockwise direction.\r\n\r\nIf the last stone falls in an occupied hole, its contents (including the last distributed counter) are distributed in a new lap starting in the next hole.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the last stone made a casa ("house"), that is a four, the contents are captured and the turn ends.\r\n\r\nIf, at any moment, a casa is made in any hole of the board, the player who is moving captures these counters.\r\n\r\nWhen the last stone is dropped into an empty hole, the turn ends.\r\n\r\nIf a player cannot move because he has no stones in his holes, he passes until he can move again.\r\n\r\nThe player who captured the last group of four but one, also gets the last four seeds and the game ends.\r\n\r\nThe winner of the game is the player who captured more stones.\r\n\r\nMatch Rules\r\nOnce a game is over another one can be started.\r\n\r\nThe following rules are observed:\r\n\r\nEach player fills as many holes on his side with four pieces from his captures as possible. The empty holes are not used in this round, but can be recovered in the next game.\r\nThe winner of the preceding round starts.\r\nThe player who leaves his opponent with less than four pieces at the end of a game, wins the match.

The hole from which the sowing continues will always be the next one in the opposite direction from the penultimate hole in which a counter was dropped. Therefore, if the sowing ends when a sowing hits an edge or corner, sowing does not continue.\r\n\r\nCaptures are made in the same way as the two player game, but captures cannot be made when the final counter falls into a hole from which a new direction must be chosen. \r\n\r\nCaptures cannot be made from the central two holes of the board. \r\n\r\nThe player who captures the most counters wins.\r\n', '"The game dongjintian is played in Simao Prefecture, Mojiang County, Jiulian Town (the county seat). The name of the game, which is Chinese, means ''moving (in the) golden fields.''. My principal informant, a Hani, knew no term for mancala in the Hani language. The game for two players is standard (2x5, no stores; five stones per hole, no large stones; pussa kanawa relays and captures, either sense of play, no rounds). But for four players there is a rather unusual game, as follows:\r\n\r\nPrincipal informant: Wang Hongbin, 23, male, Hani nationality. Interviewed March 1994.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: The board is 4 x 5, with five stones per hole. There are no large stones. \r\n\r\nSectors: None, A player may play from any of the 20 holes on the board.\r\n\r\nSowing: The first stone may be sown in any hole horizontally or vertically neighboring the hole being played; subsequently stones are sown forward, left, or right, but may not double back. Thus if a corner hole is lifted it may be sown in two directions; if one of the ten holes on the edge of the board which are not corners are played there are three possible directions, and if one in the middle six holes is lifted, there are four possible directions. If a stone has been sown in a corner, edge, or middle hole and there remain stones to be sown, there are respectively one, two, or three possible choices for the hole in which to sow the next stone. This results in a huge number of possible moves. For example, if four stones are lifted from one of the holes diagonally neighboring a corner, there are 52 different ways in which they can be sown. \r\n\r\nRelays and captures: These are pussa kanawa, but can only be made straight aead in the direction in which the last stone was sown. That is, after the last stone of a sowing is played, the contents of the neighboring hole in the opposite direction from the hole in which the penultimate stone was sown are lifted and sown. If this hole is empty, the contents of the hole beyond, if any, are captured. This results in diminished possibility of relay and capture. If the last stone lands in a corner, no relay or capture is possible. If the last stone lands in an edge-hole, but the penultimate stone was sown in a middle hole, again there is no relay or capture. Stones lying in one of the two holes at the midpoints of the two internal rows cannot be captured at all." Eagle 1995:57-58.', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

', '"In South India there are several variations of a game known in Tamil as pallanguli, or "Manyholes." In view of the fact that it resembles-superficially, at any rate-the universal African game, and that several notes on the African varieties have recently been published, the following description may be of interest. Pallanguli is played on a wooden board which may be quite plain or may be beautifully carved and ornamented. The board has two parallel rows of holes scooped out. The number of holes varies, but in the particular variation which I propose to describe there are seven holes each side. Sometimes at either end of the board is a large hole for holding the captured pieces. The stones of the tamarind, tiny pebbles, or small cowrie shells are used as pieces, the last-mentioned being preferred because they make an attractive sound as they fall into the holes in course of play.\r\nThe two players sit down with the board between them and begin by placing\r\nsix pieces in each of the seven holes on their own side.\r\nThe first player picks up the pieces from any one hole on his own side, and,\r\nmoving always in a counter-clockwise direction, places one piece in each of the holes as he goes, leaving, of course, the hole from which he picks up the pieces empty.\r\nHaving deposited the last piece in a hole containing others (either on his own or his opponent''s side) he picks up all the pieces in the hole next the one he ended in and proceeds as before still in the counter-clockwise direction. The move ends when he puts his last piece into a hole next to an empty one. When he does this he captures all the pieces in the hole on the further side of the empty one in the clockwise direction. If this hole is also empty the move ends, but he captures nothing.\r\nIt is now his opponent''s turn to play. He may start anywhere on his own side, and, moving in the counter-clockwise direction, he proceeds in the same way until his move ends in a capture or a blank. Each player plays thus in turn until the board is cleared. During the course of the game empty holes gradually become filled, and as soon as the number of pieces in a hole becomes " four " the players on whose side the " four " is removes them from the board and adds them to the pieces already captured. A "four" is called a pasu, which means a "cow," which is interesting as being a probable survival from days when, as in Africa, the game was a parody of cattle raiding. At the end of the first round, when the board is cleared, each player puts back his winnings, six to a hole, into as many holes on his own side as he can fill. The loser of the first round will not be able to fill all his seven holes, and into the empty holes he puts a bit of paper or leaf or other rubbish to show that it is not in use, and these holes are known as peekkuli, or dung holes. Any pieces left over less than six are retained. The winner of the last round fills each of his seven holes with six pieces and, of course, will have a balance of few or many pieces in proportion to the number of holes his opponent has been unable to fill.\r\nThe right to play first alternates round by round, and who ever did not begin last round starts off on his own side before, and the game proceeds exactly as in first round, except that the rubbish holes are left out.\r\nThe game goes on until eventually one or other of the players has not even enough pieces to fill one hole. During any round by skillful play'' it may be possible to capture sufficient pieces to enable the player to reopen one or more rubbish heaps, and even, of course, turn the tables on the other, and, consequently, a great number of rounds may have to be played before the game is won outright.\r\nPallanguli is really a women''s game in South India, and they play it when the morning''s work is finished. Men do sometimes play it as a gambling game.\r\nI believe there are penalties for cheating, but I am not certain, as I do not remember ever having incurred any.\r\nNo deliberate counting of pieces before a move is allowed, but observant and experienced players can tell at a glance what is the best move."

The pieces can move across any number of squares you please, but must move, or course, along the lines. The purpose is for the one side to take all the pieces of the other, and the game is then won.

Before the game proper starts each player distributes his men four to each square in his first row. The object of this is to ensure that each player has the correct number of men. Having checked this each player proceeds to allot his men betweenthe sixteen squares on his own side of the board as best pleases him. There is no rule as to the number which may be placed in any square and any square may receive any number of men or none at all...In his own interest he will not place men in squares or rows one and to which are opposite to each other, as this is the position in which his opponent can take them\r\n\r\n5. Choice of first move. With the Baganda this is a matter of mutual agreement and they do not usually bother to spin a coin or decide in any other arbitrary way. In second and subsequent games the loser always starts.\r\n\r\n6. The move. A player moves by taking all the men which are in any one square (provided there are two or more) and distributing them one at a time to each successive square starting at the square next to the one vacated and moving in an anti-clockwise direction. It does not matter whether a square traversed by the hand is occupied or vacant - each square receives one man and no more. If the last man falls into a vacant square the move is finished, but if it falls into a square already occupied the move is relayed, i.e., the men in that square together with the one which has just arrived are taken up and distributed one at a time to each successive square, still moving in an anti-clockwise direction, and starting from the square on the anti-clockwise side of the square just vacated. (By anti-clockwise side of a square is meant the left hand side of a square in the second row or the right hand side of a square in the first row. if men are taken from the left hand end of the square of the second row the first man is dropped into the left hand end square of the first row. If taken from the right hand end square of the first row the first man is dropped into the right hand end square of the second row.)\r\n\r\n7. Taking of opponent''s men. If the last man of a player''s move falls into a square in the second row which is occupied and if the two squares directly in line with it in the opponent''s first and second rows are occupied the player takes whatever number of men are in those two squares and distributes them one at a time to each successive square, moving in an anti-clockwise direction, but starting from the square on the anti-clockwise side of the square on which own side of the board which he last left empty. If, when he has done this, the last man again falls into an occupied square which is opposite to two occupied squares of his opponent he takes whatever men are in those squares and distributes them in the same way, starting necessarily from the same square as previously, because that will again be the one in the anti-clockwise side of the square last left empty. He continues to repeat the operation so long as the requisite conditions prevail, i.e., his last man falls into an occupied square in line with two occupied squares of his opponent. If, however, his last man falls into an occupied square which is in line with two of his opponent''s, only one of which or neither of which is occupied he just relays his move as provided under Rule 6. He continues taking and relaying until such time as his move finishes because his last man falls into an empty square.\r\n\r\n8. Moving backwards. Moving backwards, i.e., in a clockwise direction, is only allowed in the following circumstances:-\r\n\r\n(a) It is only permissible to move backwards by starting from the two squares at the left hand end of the first row or the two squares at the left hand end of the second row row.\r\n\r\n(b) The move must immediately result in the taking of some opponent''s men.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the men may be started from either side of the square last left empty, but in the case of a start from the square on the clockwise side of the empty square the move must immediately result in the taking of some more opponent''s men. Having taken all the men possible by moving in a clockwise direction, the player continues his move in an anti-clockwise direction by starting to distribute the last lot of captured men from the square on the anti-clockwise side of the empty square, relaying where possible, and finishing when the last man falls into an empty square. Moving backwards is known as "Okutebuka"—"To go back."\r\n\r\n9. Penalties: A player upsetting the board loses the game. There is no penalty for making a mistake in distributing men, but the mistake, if noticed, must be corrected.\r\n\r\n10. Counting men. As a square may contain so many men that it is impossible to see at a glance how many there are, a player may at any time count the number of men in any square on either his own or his opponent''s side of the board."

They all the game Kpo, a word having an explosive sound resembling a note of the xylophone, mimicking the noise made by the seeds or ivory balls with which the game is played when tossed into the holes on the board. The boards, which are made with twelve holes in two rows, with large holes at the ends., are called by the same name. The boards used by the chiefs are often very expensive, being made of ivory and ornamented with gold. He had seen boards which cost 20 slaves. The holes in the boards are called kpo sing or kpo kungo, kungo meaning . "cup." The game is usually played with sea beans, which grow on vines like the potato on the west coast, or by the chiefs with the before-mentioned ivory balls. These seeds are called kpo kunje, kunje meaning "seed." He identified a board from the Gaboon River as suitable for the game, although he said that much more elaborate ones, like those of the Liberian exhibit, were common. The depression in the middle of the board from the Gaboon River is intended to catch pieces that do not fall in the hole for which they are intended. Cheating is practiced, and to guard against it players must raise their arms and throw the pieces upon the board with some violence. Two, three, or four play. The game differs somewhat from that played in Syria and Egypt. A player may commence at any hole on his side. His play ends when the pieces first taken up are played. He wins when the number in the last hole is increased to two or three. He does not take those in the hole opposite. When two play, four beans are put in each hole, but when three or four play three beans are put in each hole. When two play, the pieces are dropped around in the same direction s in the Syrian game, but  when three or four play they may be dropped in either direction. When two play, each player takes one side of the board; when three play, each takes four hole, two on each side, dividing the board transversely into three parts, and when four plat, each takes three holes. When two play, a winner takes only what he "kills" (fá); but when three or four play, when one completes two or three in a hole by this play, he takes those in the next hole forward. When a man takes a piece with one next to it, he uses his fingers to squeeze the pieces into his hand, the operation being called "squeezing" (boti), but this can only be done when one of the pieces is in one of the player''s own cups and the other one or two in that of an opponent. Players sit crosslegged upon the ground. and when the chiefs play large numbers often assemble to watch them. I have given Prince Momolu''s account somewhat in length, as several African travelers have declared the game incomprehensible to a white man."

When he reaches an unoccupied hole the move is completed and it is his opponent''s turn to make a move.3. A LAP may be of two kinds, simple or incremented. A SIMPLE LAP may constitute a move if it ends in an unoccupied hole, and in the Lango version an incremented lap may also constitute a move. But one move may include many simple and incremented laps.\r\nBy a SIMPLE LAP iS meant the act of lifting two or more marbles from a hole and dropping them one by one in the succeeding holes, according to the rules of the particular code. If the final marble rests in an unoccupied hole both the lap and the move are completed. If, however, the final marble rests in a hole containing one or more marbles, these are again lifted together with the marble dropped into the hole and the movement is continued as before, constituting a new lap of the same move. In this way there may be a succession of simple laps before the marble finally comes to rest in an unoccupied hole, when the move is completed.\r\nBy an INCREMENTED LAP is meant a lap which starts by capturing and confiscating marbles from the opponent''s half of the board, in accordance with the rules of the particular code. Only in the Lango version can an incremented lap begin a move. A move may thus consist of a series of simple and incremented laps, and the order of their succession is conditioned by no limiting rules, but purely by the positions occupied by the marbles of the player and his opponent.\r\n4. By INCREMENT is meant the seizure of such of the opponent''s marbles as may be en prise according to the rules of the particular code. A player has no option in the matter but is obliged to take marbles which are lying en prise, and should he by an oversight fail to do so his opponent may insist on a replay of the move.\r\n5. The OPENING consists of the preliminary moves, which are made by the two players simultaneously in order to obtain position. The player who first completes his opening has the first move in the game.\r\nGeneral Principles.\r\nThe game is played on a BOARD* containing 32 holes, arranged in four parallel rows of eight holes each. The two inner rows are known as FRONT ROWS, the two outer rows as BACK ROWS. Each hole contains two marbles.\r\nThe board is divided into two halves, each player having 16 holes for play and 32 marbles. On the chart the holes of player A are indicated by capital letters, those of player B by small letters.\r\nThe block of four left-hand holes of each player constitutes a TURNING BASE.\r\nThe object of the game is to deprive the opponent of all his marbles or of as many of them as will prevent his moving. In order to make a move at least two marbles must be together in the same hole.\r\nDidinga Variation.\r\nThe marbles are moved counter-clockwise and are dropped one in each hole starting at the hole next to that from which they have been lifted. Thus 10 marbles at hole c, if moved, would be dropped singly in d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, m. Should m be vacant the move then ends. Should m however be occupied by one or more marbles, these, together with the marble dropped in m, continue the movement, starting at n, and the move continues in this way till the last marble in the hand coincides with an empty hole.\r\nIf the last marble in the hand drops into a hole in the player''s front row which is already occupied, and both the corresponding holes on the opponent''s side of the board are also occupied, the marble is left in the hole and the marbles from the opponent''s two holes are treated as increment and are captured. With these marbles the player plays an incremented lap, starting again to drop the marbles singly at the hole from which he began the move or, if there have been more than one lap, at the hole from which the last lap started. For example, the player starts at m with 4 marbles, and drops one each at n, o, p, a, but finding 2 marbles at a (which now number 3) he takes them up and drops them at b, c, d, d is occupied by one or more marbles, and at I there are three marbles and at L there are four marbles. These 7 marbles form an increment which the player picks up and with them begins again at b, which was the starting hole of the last lap of the move, and dropping one at each hole ends at h. If h is unoccupied the move now ends; but if it is occupied and E and P are also occupied, he takes up his new increment from E and P and staits again from b. If neither or only E or P is occupied, he continues the move with the marbles which he finds at h, as before.\r\nThe player may start his move from any hole which he thinks most advantageous, and it is not incumbent on him to make a move which will result in an increment. Though increments are necessary in order to attain the final object of the game, at certain stages and in certain dispositions a tactical advantage may often be gained by so playing as temporarily to avoid an increment.\r\nThe players make their moves alternately till one is rendered immobile, either through having lost all his marbles or through his remaining marbles being disposed singly.\r\nAt the beginning of the game the board is arranged with two marbles in each hole, and before the game proper commences the opening has to be played. The preliminary opening is conducted as speedily as possible by both players simultaneously, starting generally at aA or bB. The two marbles are lifted by each from the hole and they proceed as described above, taking the opponent''s marbles whenever they are en prise, and each continuing until he ends in a vacant hole. Should the players start the opening further to the left than aA, say at pP, it is obvious that, as there are only two marbles in the hole, the first lap of the opening will end while the players are still in the back row. For the purpose of the opening only and not in the game proper an opponent''s marbles are en prise at this stage of play even if the player concludes a lap in the back row. Thus a player starts at 1 and drops a marble at m, n: if his opponent has not moved his marbles from FO, he may take these\r\n(which will of course number 4) and drop them at m, n, o, p: similarly he takes the marbles from HM (if they are still there) and again drops them at m, n, o, p. p must now contain 4 marbles, viz., the original 2 plus 1 from each increment, and taking these up he continues the move by dropping them at a, b, c, d and so on until the move is completed. The opponent''s marbles are only en prise to the back row at the beginning of the opening: once the player has turned the corner and reached c increments can only be taken from the front row.\r\nUsually players start their opening simultaneously from the same hole and generally from aA or bB; but this is not obligatory and an expert player will often start from another hole unobserved by his opponent in order to secure a different\r\n" position " or arrangement of marbles which he can exploit by his superior technique to greater advantage. There is a great deal of finesse in the opening and an expert\r\nby observing his opponent, who is playing simultaneously, and by increasing or retarding the speed of his own play may secure a disposition of marbles which will\r\ngive him a tactical advantage even if he has to concede his opponent the first move in the game."

Il existe des tabliers, rares dans cette partie de l''Afrique, soutenus per des figures humain assises (voir MRAC, objet no. R.G. 59.8.3). Les dimensions du tablier varient en fonction des graines employées: dans le cas ou celles-ci sont les graines des arbres "pictantus makombo" (lingala: "ngola" or "canarium schweinfurtii" (ciluba: "menga") le tablier peut atteindre 70 cm de long et 35 de large, mais si l''on utilise les petites graines rondes d''arbres comme le kapokier il ne dépasse guère les 40cm x 20 cm. Dans ce dernier cas, les cases sont probablement un peu plus profondes que d''habitude pour empêcher les graines de sauter d''un trou à l''autre pendant la semaille. \r\n\r\nB5/1.2 Règles.\r\n\r\n1. Au deebut on place 3 graines dans chaque case de rangées extérieures, ceci pour contrôler le nombre total. \r\n\r\n2.

On peut choisir de joueur une graine uniquer. \r\n\r\n5. Les étapes d''une manoeuvre à relais sont enchaînées d''une manière qui diffère do tous les autres jeux connus au Zaïre: quand la dernière graine d''une semaille est versée, l''on ramasse les graines so trouvant dans la case suivante et continue de jouer en les semant normalement. \r\n\r\n6. Si cette case suivante est  vide, le joueur "dort" et passe la main. Ceci fait qu''on peut dormir indifféremment dans une case occupée ou vide, pour autant qu''elle soit précédée d''une case vide. \r\n\r\n7. Les prises sont également effectuées de manière particulière: on "mange" les graines se trouvant dans les deux cases, ou seulement dans la case de la rangée intérieure, opposées à une case occupée de sa propre range intérieure. Au cas où deux cases sont menacées toutes les deux doivent obligatoirement être vides. Les prises se font avant de jouer ses propres graines ou de procéder à une étape subséquente d''une manoeuvre à relais.\r\n\r\n8. Dans le cas d''une étape subséquente, la prise se fait dans la case ou les cases face, non à celle où fut déposée la dernière graine de la semaille, mais à la suivante, c''est-à-dire celle d''où l''on ramasserait les graines pour l''étape subséquente. Il s''en suit qu''aucune prise m''est possible, là où une nouvelle étape ne peut pas être enchaînée.\r\n\r\n9.

The store to the right of the player belongs to the player.\r\n\r\nPlay begins with five counters in each regular hole, with one larger stone in each store, but one is slightly smaller than the other.\r\n\r\nGame can be played with two or four players. With four players, two players control the larger stones, but cannot move the regular counters. \r\n\r\nPlayers throw out a finger (index, little, or thumb) to determine who plays first. index beats thumb, thumb beats little finger, little finger beats index. This happens at the start of each round.\r\n\r\nCounters are taken from any of the holes in the player''s row, sowing them in either direction, including the stores. When the last counter of a sowing is dropped in a hole, sowing continues by picking up the counters in the next hole and continuing to sow in that direction. If the hole following the last seed of a sowing is empty, the counters in the hole following this empty hole are captured. If there is an empty hole following the captured hole, and then an occupied hole immediately after it, the counters in the occupied hole are also captured, and so forth until there are two occupied or two empty holes in a row. \r\n\r\nMoves may not begin from stores. Both stores are sown into normally by both players. Stores are considered to be empty, except when its large stone remains in it, then the large stone only can be sown or captured and not any other counters that may have accumulated there. Large stones can be sown in any order a player chooses during a sowing.\r\n\r\nIf a player has no counters in their holes, they may opt to place one counter in each of their holes, taking counters from their store and continue play (called huelshe). If they opt not to, the opponent takes all the remaining stones on the board. If one of the large stones remains in its original store, the player cannot opt out. If the player doesn''t have enough stones for all of the holes, they may choose which holes in their row to place the counters, but they must form a continuous sequence of holes with counters. \r\n\r\nWhen the round ends, players must buy back their large stones if they no longer have them, at a price determined in the beginning of the game (usually seven for the larger stone and six for the smaller).

The seller then receives five holes to either repay debt or fill holes as long as debt does not exceed four. \r\n\r\nSold holes are always meant to be empty. Anything sown into it is immediately taken by its owner and put in the store and it cannot be sown into during huelshe by either player. \r\n\r\nA player can buy back one of these previously sold holes, but must borrow counters from the opponent in order to fill it. \r\n \r\n(VARIANT: Two rows of seven with seven counters in each hole; large stones cost seven counters between rounds).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '"A.

Interviews conducted in May 1992 and May 1993 (ages as of 1992).\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Normally the board is 2x5, with two larger storeholes, one at each end. Each of the 10 regular holes contains 5 stones at the outset. Each store contains one large stone. The two large stones are slightly different in size. The marger is the mu, female, ie the nanny-goat, the smaller is the gong, male, ie the billy-goat. (These terms are Chinese).\r\nPlayers and their sectors: The game is played either by two or four players. In the two-player game, each player''s sector consists of the five holes on one side of the board. THe store to his right belongs to him, but is outside the sector, as no player can play from a store. In the four-player game, there are two inactive players, each owning a store, and two active players, each with the five holes on one side of the board. Only the active players sow.\r\n\r\nTerminology: The kolomei is a large hole, or storehole, one at each end. The kolosso is a small home, or regular hole. five on each side. The lubasso is a small stone (''mei,'' meaning ''female,'' here has a sense of ''large,'' which ''sso'', meaning ''male,'' here means ''small.'')\r\n\r\nPreliminaries: To decide who goes first,  the two active players simultaneaously throw out either thumb, index finger, or little finger of their right hands. Then the result is determined by the following cycle: index finger (snake) beats thumb (frog), which beats little finger (centipede), which in turn beats index finger. This procedure is followed at  the start of each round. \r\n\r\nPLay: Play is in either direction throughout the game. Captures and relays are of the standard pussa kanawa type: relay from the postultimate hole of a sowing; if this and the next hole are both empty, the move ends with no capture. If the postultimate hole is empty and the following hole is not, then capture from an alternating sequence of empty and non-empty holes beginning with the postultimate hole. Captures are removed from the board, and are set aside, to be reckoned at the end of the round. Following capture, a move ends.\r\n\r\nThe large stones are played, relayed and captured just like the small stones. In sowing the contents of a hole containing both large and small stones, the stones may be sown in any order.\r\n\r\nStores: A move may not begin from a store. Both stores are sown into normally by both players. The large stone which is originally in a store is captured and relayed normally by both players. But small stones are not captured or relayed from a store, nor is a large stone which has left its original store. Stores are sinks, in that whatever is sown in them never comes out, bu in effect has been captured by the owner of the store. Hence, except when a store contains a large stone which never left it, it is always ''empty.'' That is, if the ultimate hole of a sowing is just before a store, then the stones in the hole following the store are captured. More generally, it counts as ''empty'' in constituting an alternating sequence of empty and non-empty holes for a capture. Stones which have fallen into a store may be removed freely by the owner and added to his stock of captured stones.\r\n\r\nHuelshe: Whenever a player whose turn it is to move has no stones in any of the holes in his sector, he may ''huelshe'' (Chinese "tianzi"), by placing a single stone in each hole in his sector, and then playing normally. If he declines to do this, the round ends, and his opponent confiscates all the stones on his side of the board. If there is still a large stone in its original store, then huelshe is obligatory, as otherwise the large stone would belong to neither player. If a player who wants to huelshe has fewer stones than holes, he may place his stones in as many holes as he can. The choice of holes is his, but there may be no gaps, that is the holes he places singletons in must be consecutive. The round ends  by mutual agreement, each player taking the few stones left in his sector.\r\n\r\nRounds: At the end of a round the players attempt to refill their holes as they were initially. The large stones, if they do not now belong to their original owners, must be bought back. Their value is by agreement, but most commonly is this: the mu is worth seven, and the gong is worth six. But it is also acceptable to value them both at five. (It is also acceptable, according to one informant, to play the game with seven holes in a row, seven stones per hole, and the large stones valued at seven).\r\n\r\nA player who, at the end of a round, has less than his original complement, must borrow from another player. The debt is remembered, and accumulates from round to round. A player who has a surplus may not refuse to lend. If a player''s debt to another reaches five, he is obliged to sell a hole. The seller chooses which of his holes to sell. In return for the hole, the seller receives five stones, which he may use to repay debt and to fill holes, so long as the debt to any player does not exceed four. \r\n\r\nSold holes: A hole which has been sold functions as a sink for the benefit of its new owner. It is always empty (that is, counts as an empty hole with respect to pussa kanawa captures for either player), and anything sown into it is immediately taken by the owner. At the start of a round it is empty, and on huelshe nothing is placed in it by either player. A player is free to relay or play a large stone into a hole he has bought,, thereby capturing it. \r\n\r\nIf a player who has sold a hole originally in his sector accumulates the five surplus stones needed to buy it back, he may do so, and his opponent may not refuse the transaction. But he must still have or borrow the stones needed to fill it. \r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, in a two-player game, that at the end of a round, after debts have been cleared, one of the players has four of the original five holes remaining in his sector, his original large stone, and 26 small stones. He then places the large stone in its store, fills each of his four holes with five stones, buys back the fifth hole for five stones, places his single remaining stone in it, and borrows the four stones necessary to fill it from his opponent.

The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole.

Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters. \r\n\r\nThroughout the game, singletons cannot be moved is a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a singleton in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other singletons in the player''s row. \r\n\r\nPlay continues until one player has no counters.

The player to begin picks up the five counters of any one of his own houses, and moving in the direction indicated by the arrows, drops the counters one by one into successive houses. Thus, if B should begin to play and should decide to start with the house marked X, the result of his first move would be as shown in Fig. 5. It will be observed that if the contents of the middle one of the five houses be taken up, they can be distributed in either direction, at the player''s choice, while counters from a house to the right of the middle one move to the right, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIt is now A''s turn to move, and, though the players are still only manoeuvring for position, it is time to indicate their ultimate object. This is, that the last counter dropped shall fall into a house of the opponent''s, containing already one counter or three counters. In either case the player removes from the board both the afore-mentioned last counter and the one counter or three counters on to which it falls. Moreover, if he scores with his last counter he is allowed to score with the penultimate counter also, if it falls on one or three; and if with the penultimate, then with the last but two also, if it falls on one or three, and so on. Thus at a late stage of the game, illustrated in Fig. 6, if the player A moves with the contents of the house marked Y, he will "eat" all the contents of B''s houses. At house Z he is said to have eaten a cow, and in each of the other houses, a calf.\r\n\r\nA very important rule is that a single counter in a house cannot be moved. Thus the only way to protect a calf from being eaten is to make a move which leaves a second counter in the house with it. Anyone who cares to try it will find that a successful "end-game" depends solely on judicious appreciation of this rule.

If the player has three counters remaining after filling as many holes with four as possible, they borrow one counter from the opponent to make four and own the corresponding hole. If there are two or one remaining, the opponent borrows these to fill and own the last hole. \r\n\r\nPlay continues until one player owns no more holes. ', '"4. Um El Banât, or The Game of Daughters\r\n\r\n"This game is for two players, each of whom has six houses containing initially four counters each (Fig. 8). It introduces a new principle in counter-distribution, in that a player, picking up the contents of one of his own houses and dropping them one by one in an anti-clockwise direction, does not end his move with the fall of the last counter unless (a) it falls into a house previously empty, or (b) it falls on to three others in one of his opponent''s houses. In other cases he picks it up, together with any together with any other counters contained in the house into which it just fell, and goes on distributing these counters, often moving several times round the board, until he is brought to a standstill by one of the happenings (a) or (b). In case (b) the player is said to have "begotten a daughter" in his opponent''s house and the house has a mark put against it to indicate the fact. The "birth" to one player or the other, of one or more "daughters," introduces a new factor into the game, and that the determining factor. For if, now, A can so move that the last counter dropped falls into the house of B''s daughter, he removes it and one other from that house and from the board and plays again. In doing so he is said to "peck" her. Also, if either player drops the last counter from his hand into the house of one of his own daughters, he is said to have "given her a drink" or to have "nourished" her and his move stops. \r\n\r\nDaughters, it will be observed, are a source for profit and a loss to their father, but all are not equally so. Fig. 9. shows a stage of the game at which B has two daughters in houses D1 and D2. If A is to move, he can begin with the two counters in house X, drop one into W and the other into D1, from which he then removes two from the board. Moving again, he can pick up the one counter just dropped into W, drop it into D1 and again remove two. Playing again from Y, he again removes two, after which he can again score by playing from W. \r\n\r\nD2, on the other hand, is much more immune from "pecking." It is true that by moving from Z, A can "peck" at her once, but he cannot repeat the process, while, also, practically every move which B makes adds to the counters in D2.\r\n\r\nThe contents of a daughter''s house cannot be piked up and moved, so that a stage of the game is completed when the board is left with no counters in it except those in the various daughter''s houses. Each player then removes the counters pertaining to his own daughters, adds them to those previously removed by him from the board and divides them into fours. In the result, B has perhaps gained eight counters from A. The game is, however, by no means ended at this point. The board is reset, only this time B has eight houses and A only four, a state of affairs indicated by a deep groove in the sand (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nIf B has gained three counters, over and above some multiple of four from A, he borrows one more from A to make up a complete house, but if B has gained a multiple of four plus two counters or one, A borrows these back to make up his last house. \r\n\r\nPlay proceeds until one player has driven the other off the board altogether, and therefore it may last for hours; for as the result of the second stage of play A may win back a house or more, and so the fortunes of the game may fluctuate for many successive stages.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it requires great skill, or, rather swift and accurate calculation, to foresee the result of a given move. Some Arabs are quite extraordinarily good at it, notably Sheikh Ali El Tom, the Nazir of the Kababish, who, with hardly any hesitation, will accurately predict the result of a move which takes him three or four times round the board."

The fact that there must be a "French wari" played on the English islands, and an "English wari" on the French-speaking ones seemed a logical conclusion, and this for of lesser prestige was first encountered and learned at Barbados. It is a simpler form of the game than that which has just been described, and the rules are as follows. The cups that appertain to each player, the manner of moving the seeds, and the object of the game, are identical with the Ashanti-Djuka-Island form that has been last described. It is the manner of the play that differs. The first player, taking the four seeds from any one of his cups, plays them about the board and then, continuing to move, takes the seeds in the cup in which his last seed has dropped, and distributes these. This continues until his last seed falls into an empty cup, in which case he takes the seeds that are in the cup opposite the one in which he finishes his play, no matter how few or how numerous they may be. If there are no seeds in the cup opposite the one where he ends play, he captures nothing.  ...It makes no difference if he ends on his own side or that of his opponent, he captures the seeds in the cup opposite the empty one in which he ends his play. He must begin his play, however, from some cup on his own side of the board. The winner is the player who at the end of the game has twenty-five or more seeds.

This can only be done in the opening move, and the object is to make what is called on all the islands a "house,"—i.e. a cup that has a large number of seeds in it. Tactically this is good if the number of seeds in such a cup be carefully counted, for having such a "house" often gives the player who possesses it an opportunity to go completely around the board and, continuing on the second round, to fill holes on his opponent''s side that are either empty or that have only one seed each.

It will be seen, however, that the modifications are such that the game under this code differs materially from both the Didinga and the Lango variations.\r\n(i) As in the Didinga variation and in contrast with the Lango code, an incremented lap begins at the starting hole of the lap leading up to the increment.\r\n(ii) The opponent''s marbles are not en prise at the beginning of the move but the player has first to move some marbles in order to reach the requisite position. That is to say, none of the opponent''s marbles can be taken before at least one lap has been played. This again conforms with Didinga usage.\r\n(iii) The opponent''s marbles are en pri,se only if, as in the Didinga code, both of the opponent''s holes are occupied opposite an occupied hole in the player''s front row in which the player drops the last marble of a lap. It is not permissable to take an inicrement if only the opponent''s front row hole is occupied, as is allowable by Lango practice.\r\n(iv) The turning base has been incorporated in a modified form:\r\n(a) Clockwise motion is permitted only from IK and ik.\r\n(b) As in the Lango code, clockwise motion is only permitted in order to take the opponent''s marbles which are en prise.\r\n(c) When an increment is taken the captured marbles are all placed in the hole from which the lap leading to the increment started.\r\n(d) If the increment is taken from the first lap of a move and the captured marbles, played clockwise, suffice to take another increment, they are taken from the hole and so played: but if there is no fresh increment available they must be played counterclockwise in the usual way starting from the hole forward of the one in which they have been deposited.\r\n(e) Alternatively the player may start the first lap in this way with a clockwise move from the turning base leading to an increment and after depositing the captured marbles in the hole from which the lap started may leave that lap entirely. He may then, if it is available, play another clockwise move from the other portion of the base and after taking the increment leave it in the same way. Having done all the execution possible by clockwise moves, he may start the move proper from that or from any other part of the board counterclockwise.\r\n(f) The rules given under (d) and (e) apply to a clockwise motion frona the turning base at the beginning of a move only. If during the course of a move a player''s marble ends at iI or kK, at which there is already one marble or more, he may, subject to an increment being available, play one lap, but only one, clockwise. After taking the increment he proceeds again counterclockwise with the captured marbles, starting at jJ or IL, as the case may be. If the move continues and he again returns to the turning base and finds other of the opponent''s marbles en prise, he may similarly play one clockwise lap and continue counterclockwise as before. That is to say, apart from preliminary attacks, in each circuit of a move only one clockwise lap is permitted...The opening is played in the same way as under the Didinga code with the addition of clockwise moves from the turning base. For the purpose of the opening only, the opponent''s marbles are en prise to the player''s back row, as has been described in the paragraph dealing with the Didinga opening."

However, if the opponent''s inner row hole is empty and the outer row is occupied, it is not in opposition. If the last hole in a sowing falls into a hole that is is in opposition, the player takes the counters in the opponent''s holes in opposition and places them in the outer row hole next to the hole from which the capture occurred.

But the code includes one important addition and several variations. \r\n(1) The opponent''s marbles are en prise either if both holes opposite the player''s are occupied or if only the hole of the front row. But if the opponent''s front row hole is empty and there are marbles in the corresponding hole of the back row these are not en prise. \r\n\r\n(2) An incremented lap in a move does not begin at the starting hole of the previous lap, but at the hole opposite which the increment was taken—e.g., a player moving 4 marbles from b drops them in c,d,e,f, and opposite f takes an increment of 3 marbles fron GN. Under the Didinga code he would start dropping the three marbles at b, but under the Lango code he drops them at f,g,h. Should there be only a single marble however in the opponent''s first row hole and none in the corresponding back row hole, this marble is taken up together with whatever marbles are in the player''s corresponding hole and these are dropped singly from the next hole. hus in the last example supposing that instead of 3 marbles from GN the player took only 1 marble from G, he would add to this his own marbles from f and start dropping them from g onwards.\r\n(3) Whereas in the Didinga variant every move must be started by the player lifting a group of his own marbles and continuing the motion until he reaches a hole at which he stops, during the course of which he may have been in a position to capture some increment from his opponent: in this variant if the opponent''s marbles are en prise, he must first take these and start dropping them at the hole opposite that from which they were taken, e.g., the player has a marble at f and his opponent is en prise at GN: the player must first take up the marbles from GN and drop them singly from f onwards and so continue the move in the usual manner. If more than one group of the opponent''s marbles are en prise the player may choose the group which will be the most advantageous to himself. If none of the opponent''s marbles is en prise the player starts his move in the same way as under the Didinga code. It is clear accordingly that in this variant a single marble in the front row may save the game even if all other marbles are taken, as it may ipso facto take any marbles in the hole opposite it.\r\n(4) The blocks of holes IJKL and ijkl form the turning bases of players A and B respectively. From these bases moves or laps may be played either clockwise or counter-clockwise, subject to the condition that a move or lap may only be played clockwise in order to take an increment which is en prise.\r\nAfter a lap played clockwise from the turning base, the marbles captured from the opponent may again be played clockwise from the same hole as originated the clockwise lap if their number suffices to take another increment, and this movement may continue as long as the captured marbles permit fresh increments. When no fresh increments are possible, the move must continue counterclockwise, starting from the hole opposite the last increment; but if during the course of the move the player on returning to the turning base finds another opportunity of taking his opponent''s marbles by a clockwise lap, he is at liberty to do so.\r\nA player is not compelled to play clockwise even if an opponent''s marbles are en prise in that direction, and it is sometimes a tactical gain to pass such an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe opening is played in the same way as in the Didinga variation, with the exception that the players must start either at aA or bB. Clockwise motion from the turning base is also permitted during the opening under the conditions described above. The opponent''s marbles are never en prise to the player''s back row."

Na que vamos descrever, as pedras comidas permanecem em jogo (Classe A) e na outra, que descrevemos a seguir em 2.2.1, saem do jogo (Classe B). \r\n\r\nA presença destas duas classes de jogos Mancala IV entre os Luenas e os Bundas explica-se, por estarem numa zona de transição entre áreas de jogos de profundas tradições e classes perfeitamente definidas— os Cuanhamas (Classe A) e o Quiocos (Classe B). Sendo assim, as duas variantes do Muvalavala não serão mais do que adaptações do Owela e do Tchela. No entanto, é do Muvalavala a única tradição da origem do jogo que recolhemos:\r\n\r\nQuadrícula — 4 x 6 a 4 x 16. O número de casas por linha não obedece a qualquer norma fixa, diminuindo à medida que desejam obter um jogo de desfecho mais répido. Não usam mais de 16 casas por linha porque, dizem, se torna incómodo oara jogar por causa das deslocações que têm de fazer para movimentar as pedras do jogo. Este motivo é na mesma considerado quando se defrontam dois grupos de jogadores. \r\n\r\nTabuleiro — Não existe, por a quadricula ser materializada no chão. Os buracos de quadrícula são geralmente abertos, rodando no solo uma pedra bicuda facetada, à semelhança duma broca.\r\n\r\nCasas — Em forma de caloe esférica, de 4 a 6 dm de diâmetro, a que chamam buraquinho, (kauina, pl. tuina). As casas da extrema esquerda da linha exterior de cada jogador são designadas por limbo. Esta designação é também dada no decorrer do jogo a todas as casas que tenham mais de três pedras. \r\n\r\nPedras — Geralmente pequenos frutos, quer em verde quer depois de secos, com 8 a 10 mm de diâmetro, a que chamam salia, ou missalia (sing. lissalia), duma árvore a que dão o nome de mussalia (Pseudolachinostylis dekindtii Pax ?). Usam também sementes de mandioca (Manihot utilissima) e doutras plantas, e pedras. \r\n\r\nO número inicial de pedras por jogador é igual a quatro vezes o número de casas por linha menos duas (4n-2); a sua distribução faz-se só na linha exterior de cada jogador, à razão de duas por casa, excepto na da extrema esquerda, onde se colocam as restantes (2n). Por este motivo é que estas casas da quadrícula são chamadas quimbos. \r\n\r\nSentido — É seguido o sentifo directo.\r\n\r\nCasas de mão — Têm de pertencer ao campo do próprio jogador e conter duas ou mais pedras.\r\n\r\nDistribuição da mão — Da mesma forma que o Owela. \r\n\r\nNo Muvalavala há que distinguir duas fases distintas do jogo:\r\n\r\n1.a fase (distribuição inicial): neste fase, em que se procuram distribuir as pedras, uma a uma por todas as casas de quadrícula (semelhança com o Tchela), não se podem jogar as pedras dos quimbos nem incluir no circuito de distribuição das pedras as casas A1, a1, B8 e b8 (caso da figura 16), pelo que estas são consideradas como se não existissem. Quando se fica com uma soó pedra em cada casa, inicia-se a 2. fase (jogo propriamente dito): esta fase é obrigatoriamente iniciada pelo quimbo, o que resulta da proibição de não se poder iniciar um lanço por uma casa com uma única pedra. A partir deste momento passam a ser utilizadas todas as casas da quadrícula. \r\n\r\nJogadas — Podem ser movimentos compostos.\r\n\r\nComer — De mesma forma que no Owela.\r\n\r\nVariantes — Não são conhecidas...\r\n\r\nInterdições — Não se conhecem.\r\n\r\nPrática — É praticado por homens, mulheres e crianças como passatempo, embora se façam às vezes apostas insignificantes, especialmente entre as crianças. Algumas designações especiais usadas:\r\n\r\nkulia (comer) — comer pedras ao adversário;\r\nnassavala mu mussenge (ir dormir no mato) — diz-se duma jogada que termina na linha exterior, e, portanto, sem qualwuer consequência para o adversário;\r\nlimbo (quimbo=aldeia) — grupo de mais de três pedras numa casa, ou a casa que as contém;\r\nngunakutape (degolei-te) — expressão que o vencedor dirige ao adversário ao ganhar o jogo."

On dropping his last ball into a hole he would lift up the entire contents of that hole, and would proceed in this manner until he reached an empty hole. If that happened on one of his own holes, with one or more balls in his opponent''s opposite hole, the player would take his last ball or counter, together with the opposite ball or balls as his winnings, but if his opponent''s opposite hole were empty the player was entitled to take nothing, and this was the case also if he alighted in one of his opponent''s empty holes. It would then be the second player''s turn to move. \r\n\r\nThe players, who were allowed to count the contents of their hole so as to calculate their moves, could now start from any of their holes provided the last ball in their hand fell on one of their own empty holes or led on to the enemy row, in which latter case it was permissible for a ball going round the board finally to alight on the player''s own side...\r\n\r\nCaptures would always be effected by alighting in an empty hole belonging to the player and facing an occupied enemy hole.\r\n\r\nPlay would continue until one of the players was unable to move because his holes were all empty. His opponent would at this point appropriate the remaining balls )which were of course now only in the latter''s row) and would place them with his previous winnings.\r\n\r\nThe two players would then count out their takings, four by four, into their holes, the player with the largest number of balls being the victor. Ahmad Al-Johari states that a player capturing enough balls to fill three or more of his opponent''s holes would be considered to have gained a particularly notable triumph, and would say, farasal kokaysé, literally "I beat you by a horse."

Trata-se, necessariamente, duma solução de recurso, mas que mostra a importância tradicional do tabuleiro. \r\n\r\nCasas— São designadas por mena (sing. uina).\r\n\r\nCabeças— Aparece, geralmente, este tipo de casas de designam por mitue (sing. mutue = cabeça (No Lumeje ouvi designar as cabeças por meso (sing. rhiso = olho)). O seu número é variavel, podendo existir uma ou duas por jogador. Quando só há duas por tabuleiro, elas são sempre exteriores à quadrícula (foto 8), situando-se à direita de cada um dos jogadores. Havendo quatro <<cabeças>>, duas são exteriores, como no primeiro caso, e as outras, interiores. Estas situam-se entre as duas linhas que pertencem a cada parceiro, no eixo do tabuleiro (fotos 6 e 7). Um dos tabuleiros representados (foto 6) tem as cabeças interiores assimétricas —A''4, A''8, B''O e B''3.\r\n\r\nAs cabeças gozam de regalias particulares, que são as seguintes: \r\n\r\nNão são consideradas no distribuição inicial das pedras; \r\nSó podem conter uma única pedra;\r\nAs pedras nelas colocadas não podem ser comidas;\r\nPodem ou não ser incluídas numa jogada, conforme a vontade do jogador;\r\nSó podem ser occpadas no sentido do jogo, considerando-se, para o efeito, as cabeças interiores como pertencentes à fila interior. \r\n\r\nNão conseguimos obter qualque informação do razão de ser das cabeças. Parece-nos, no entanto, que elas fazem parte do jogo já há muito tempo e que foram introduzidas com o fim de dar maid maleabilidade aos jogos de reduzido número de colunas, tornando-os mais difíceis. \r\n\r\nDepósitos— Existem dois depósitos em todos os tabuleiros que conhecemos.\r\n\r\nPedras —São designadas por sache (sing. lucache (no Lumeje ouvi designar as pedras por dumbue (sing. lundumbue))) e normalmente constituídas por pequenos seixos ou sementes. Destas, as mais usadas são as de mumanga (Brackystegia manda De Wild), coconote, vulgarmente conhecido por dendém (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) e mpáfu, ou mupáfu (Canarium schweinfurthii Engl. (Em Sandando utilizam sementes designadas por kapango, do nome da árvore)). O número de pedras usado é de uma por casa da quadrícula, não incuindo as cabeças. \r\n\r\nSentido–Directo.\r\n\r\nCasas de mão — Têm de pertencer ao campo do jogador e não podem ter uma só pedra, excepto se for uma cabeça, enquanto houver outras com mais do que uma. \r\n\r\nDistribuição— A primeira jogada não segue a regra general. Nesta, que tem por fim agrupar as pedras aos pares, toma-se a pedra duma casa qualquer e junta-se à da casa seguinte, o que forma o primeiro par; toma-se a pedra d casa imediata e procede-se de igual forma, e assim successivamente; a jogada termina com a distribuição normal do último par formado.

Na primeira jogada pode-se já ocupar qualquer cabeça...a dispisição das pedras depois desta jogada será indicada na figura 18. \r\n\r\nA jogada seguinte de A obedecerá já à regra geral. \r\n\r\nNo decorrer do jogo aparece outra excepção: a jogada designada por kutchina (fugir);\r\n\r\nSupunhamos a distribuição indicada na figura 19 e que é o parceiro A a jogar:\r\n\r\nO jogador A pode mover a pedra de A2 para a1, saltando a casa A1, e evitar assim que seja comida pela pedra de B''0 ou b1. No caso de a1 estar ocupanda poderia passar para a2, o que corresponde à posição do jogador B. Neste caso, a pedra de B7 saltava para b7, fugindo a ser comida pela de A''8. \r\n\r\nJogadas—Podem ser movimentos compostos. \r\n\r\nComer— Só pode comer a última pedra da distribuição de uma mão desde que esta termine numa casa vazua da linha interior. \r\n\r\nEsta pedra come todas as pedras adversárias existentes nessa coluna se a casa da linha interior estiver ocupada."

Two persons play at this, with a board (or two boards joined by hinges) in which are twelve hemispherical holes, called "buyoot" (plural of "beyt"}, in two equal rows ; and with seventy-two small shells, of the kind called cowries ; or as many pebbles : these, whether shells or pebbles, are termed the (in the singular, "hasweh").\r\nTo explain the game of the mankalah, I must distinguish the beyts of the board by letters, thus : -\r\n\r\nThe beyts marked A, B, C, D, E, F, belong to one party; and the opposite six beyts to the other. One of the parties, when they are about to play the game in the most simple manner (for there are two modes of playing it), distributes all the unequally into the beyts ; generally putting at least four into each beyt. If they were distributed equally, there would be six in each beyt ; but this is seldom done ; for, in this case, he who plays first is sure to lose. The act of distributing the is called "tebweez." When one party is dissatisfied with the other''s distribution of the he may turn the board round ; and then his adversary begins the game ; which is not the case otherwise. Supposing the party\r\nto whom belong the beyts A, B, C, D, E, F, commences the game, he takes the from beyt F, and distributes them to the beyts a, b, c, &c., one to each beyt ; and if there be enough to put in each of his adversary''s six beyts, and more remain in his hand, he proceeds in the same manner to distribute them to his own beyts, in the order A, B, C, &c. ; and then,if he have still one or more remaining, to his adversary''s beyts, as before, and so on. If the last beyt into which he has put a contain but one (having been empty before he put that in; for it may have been left empty at the first,) he ceases ; and his adversary plays : but if it contain two or four, he takes its contents, with those of the beyt opposite ; and if the last beyt contain two or four, and one or more of the preceding beyts also contain either of these numbers, no beyt with any other number intervening, he takes the contents of these preceding beyts also, with the contents of those opposite. If the last beyt into which he has put a contain (with this three, or five, or more, he takes these out, and goes on distributing them in the same manner as before ; for instance, if, in this case, the last beyt into which he has put a be D, he puts one from its contents into E, another into F, a third into a, and so on ; and thus he continues, until making the last beyt to contain but one stops him, or making it to contain two or four brings him gain, and makes it his adversary''s tum to play. He always plays from beyt F, or, if that be empty, from the nearest beyt to it in his own row con- taining one or more When one party has more than a single in one or more of his beyts, and the other has none, the former is obliged to put one of his into the first of his adversary''s beyts. I f only one remain on one side, and none on the other, that one is the property of the person on whose side it is. When the board is completely Cleared, each party counts the number of the he has taken ; and the one who has most reckons the excess of his above his .adversary''s number as his gain. The gainer in one board begins to play the next board; his adversary having first distributed the When either party has made his suc- cessive gains amount to sixty, he has won the game.-In this manner, the game of the manl5-alah is played by young persons ; and hence this mode of playing it is called "the game of the ignorant" (" el-ghasheem ")..."

Le jeu est connu en Malaisie sous le nom de papan-dakon papân, malais, signifiant planche, dakon paraissant n''être pas une racine malaise, mais plutôt javanaise. Cependant, à l''interior de Java, il se nomme tjonglak, jôngklak. Il est dakoun, dakun, sur les côtes de Java et à Borneo. Ici comme en Afrique, le nom vernaculaire ne peut guère apporter de renseignements, seule une étude approfondie de tous les vernaculaires pourrait indiquer des filiations vraies. \r\n\r\nLe seconde, plus importante, est qu''il se joue de droite à gauche, dans le sense du mouvement des aiguilles d''une montre, ce que nous ne rencontrons nulle part ailleurs.\r\n\r\nLa troisième, plus importante encore, est que les cases des extrémités, qui partout ailleurs servent à placer les gains — que dans le feu de l''action on laisse le plus souvent trainer par terre— sont ici fonctionelles. Dans une variante élémentaire jouée par les fillettes, et quelquefois même par les adultes, qui en font un jeu de hasard, elles sont même l''élément essentiel du jeu. On place un certain nombre de noyaux, de cailloux ou de coquillages égal dans chaque trou, puis la joueuse prend la noyaux, de cailloux ou coquillages, d''un trou qui, dans certaines règles, est la premier à droite, en quel cas tout le jeu est déterminé, et n''est plus ni un jeu d''intelligence, ni un jeu de hasard, mais requiert seulement un peu d''attention pour ne pas tricher involontairement, ou pour tricher volontairement; ou bien c''est un des trous au choix de joueur, en quel cas des qualités stratégiques et tactiques peuvent intervenir. Elle égrène ses billes une par une dans chaque trou, en plaçant une au passage dans le trou d''éxtremité qui est à sa gauche, sa <<mère>> ou son <<tas>>. Quand la dernière bille tombe dans un trou occupé, elle prend les billes de ce trou et continue jusqu''à ce qu''elle trouve une <<maison>> vide ou qu''elle s''arrête chez sa mère. En quels cas la main passe. Les seuls prises sont dont les billes placées en tournant chez les mères. C''est un jeu de hasard pour les fillettes— à l''âge où elles ne se sont pas encore aperçu qu''une comptine bien menée désigne qui on veut. Pour un adulte qui sait jouer, les quelques coups nécessaires pour s''assurer le gain sont assez aisés à retenir.\r\n\r\nLe jeu d''adultes est beaucoup plus compliqué (La règle que je vais donner a été recueillie à Bandjermasin (Bornéo) par Mme Imbert-Prosé, mais le jeu est le même à l''intérieur de Java.); c''est un jeu d''hommes et surtour de viellards (Il est aussi joué à Java et à  Borneo par les Chinois que passionnent tous les jeux d''argent, est celui -ci en est un.). Il se joue sur un plateau de bois de fer, très lourd, très résistant, souvent ouvragé, qui se transmet dans la famille durant des nombreuses générations. Le plateau comporte deux rangées de 7 cases et, à chaque extrémité, une case, la <<mère>> ou le <<tas>>, chaque joueur disposant des 7 cases <<enfants>> ou <<maison>> qui sont devant lui, et de la <mère>>, qui est à sa gauche (fig. 386). On joue à Java, sur le côte, avec des cauris, à Bornéo, avec des coquillages ronds, bruns, provenant des rizières, on joue aussi avec des noyaux ou des cailloux; on place en général 7 coquillages par trou, quelquefoid plus, mais jamais moins. \r\n\r\nLes joueurs— et ceci constitue une nouvelle particularité—commencent ensemble (Je n''ai pas le détail des règles pour le cas où ils se présentent ensemble dans la même case, cas certainement prévu dans un jeu dont la règle est si précise et si compliquée, et joué par des gens, Malais, Chinois, très minutieux dans tous leurs comportements sociaux. Le fait de commencer ensemble n''existe en Europe, à ma connaissance, que dans certains jeux de billard, peut-être d''origine orientale). Chacun prend les 7 billes d''une des cases à son choix et les égrène une par une dans le sens du mouvement des aiguilles d''une montre, plaçant au passage une bille dans son tas et n''en plaçant pas, évidemment, dans celui de l''adversaire. Quand la dernière bille tombe dans une case occupée, le joueur prend les billes de ce cette case et les égrène à leur tour, jusqu''à ce que la dernière bille en main tombe dans une case vide ou dans le tas du joueur, en quels cas la main passe. Les deux joueurs ont commencé ensemble mais l''un des deux poursuivra son jeu plus longtemps, après quoi il repassera la main au premier et le jeu continuera, chaque joueur jouant à son tour comme dans les jeux que nous avons déjà rencontrées...\r\n\r\nLes Prises. Quand la dernière bille égrenée tombe dans une <<maison>> occupée du joueur, il peut prendre le contenu de cette maison et continuer comme nous l''avons vu; mais il peut également poser cette dernière bille dans la maison opposée de son partenaire, et mettre le contenu de cette maison, plus cette dernière bille dans son tas, après quoi il égrènera le contenu de sa maison...Il n''est jamais obligé de prendre ainsi, et l''avantage tactique d''une prise immédiate compromet souvent les résultats meilleurs d''une stratégie habile.\r\n\r\n5.

Si le nombre de billes dont il dispose n''est pas multiple de 7, les billes en excès seront remises dans son tas. Le gagnant mettra dans chacune de ses maison le plus grand nombre des billes possible, chacune en contenant un nombre égal; quand il n''a plus assez de billes pour en mettre une das chaque maison, il place le reste dans son tas. Les cases vides du perdant sont dites maison brûlées...\r\n\r\nLes maison brûlées ne comptent plus. Si par erreur un joueur y verse une bille, son partenaire lui imposera comme amende au prochain tour de commencer par tel pot qu''il lui deisgnera. Quand un joueur a des maison brûlées, celui qui a toutes ses maisons doit commencer par une des cases opposées aux maison brûlées. \r\n\r\nLe jeu s''achève en principe, et sauf conventions particulières, quand toutes les maisons d''un joueur sont brûlées."

Contactámos com o soba grande Candimba e com vários velhos da zona. Todos se lembram do jogo, que era igual ao dos Quibalas, e de ele ter sido muito praticado no tempo do pai e do avô do actual soba, e por eles próprios, mas há muito tempo que não está em uso. Um dos informadores disse que talvez ainda se encontrasse alguém que o soubesse jogar na área da Epila, junto do rio Cunhangama, afluente do Queve. Este essquecimento do jogo explica-se por os Bailundos se encontrarem profundamente desarreigados das tradições  tribais, em consequência da sua intensa emigração, como contratados, para outras regiões, em especial para as fazendas de café do Norte. O mesmo sucede com os Huambos e os Quiacas, que tembém praticaram um jogo igual ou idêntico, mas que presentamente o desconhecem.\r\n\r\nQuadrícula—4 x 6 e 4 x 7.\r\n\r\nTabuleiro— De madeira. São designados por <<quela>>, nome do jogo. Existe um por sanzala, propriedade tradicional do soba, que passa de geração em geração, e que é utilizado por todos os homens, que geralmente jogam com o soba ou na sue presença. É interdita a existência doutros tabuleiros. Tivemos a confirmação prática deste uso, ao depararem-se-nos sérias dificuldades na aquisição do tabuleiro do soba grande Sebastião Dumbo (foto 14) , quando nos informaram, em grande segredo, que talvez fosse possível conseguir o do velho Francisco Candamba, que o tiunha escondido (foto 26a).\r\n\r\nO tabuleiro encontra-se sempre colocado sobre um aflormento granítico (muito abundantes mesmo dentro da área das sanzalas) , suficientemente espaçoso para a prática do jogo e seus assistentes, situado em frente da casa do soba, de fundo para o ar, exposto ao sol e à chuva. Por esta razão, os tabuleiros antigos encontram-se smepre muito deteriorados. \r\n\r\nOs três tabuleiros observados têm todos a mesma forma básica: o rectângulo da quadrícula é sobreelevado em relação aos bordos e contornado por uma aba, que alarga nas extremidades, e que serve se dépositos (foto 27). \r\n\r\nComo recurso, não havendo tabuleiro, podem abrir uma quadrícula no chão. \r\n\r\nCasas-Podem ser circulares ou quadrangulares. \r\n\r\nDepósitos— Não existem depósitos, propriamente ditos. \r\n\r\nPedras— São utilizadas sementes ósseas, quase pretas, a que chamam lasseta, dum arbusto espinhoso a que dão o mesmo nome.\r\n\r\nO número de pedras por jogador é igual ao dobro de casas por linha. \r\n\r\nNo início do jogo, as pedras são dispostas, aos pares, nas casas da linha exterior, esta distribuição tem exclusivamente por fim a verificação do número de pedras em jogo.\r\n\r\nDe notar ume particularidade curiosa: as pedras do jogo da banza do Catúmbi estavam guardadas no crânio duma hiena, colocado sobre o tabuleiro (foto 14).  \r\n\r\nSegundo informação do soba grande, é hábito guardar as lassetas em crânios de hiena, onça ou leão, mas não conseguimos obter qualquer explicação para este costume. \r\n\r\nSentido—Directo.\r\n\r\nCasas de mão— Têm de pertencer ao campo do jogador e não podem ter uma só pedra enquanto houver outras com mais do que uma. \r\n\r\nDistribuição da mão— A forma de distribuir a mão segue a regra geral desde que se considere na fase inicial do jogo uma quadrícula limitada pela supressão dumas casas, com uma só excepção. Vejamos como se procede:\r\n\r\nFase inicial: após a distribuição das pedras, aos pares, pela linha exterior, os dois jogadores procedem ao arranjo arbitrário das suas pedras, geralmente só nesta linha; quando se ocupam casas da linha interior é com uma só pedra. Por regra, o maior número de pedras é sempre colocado na casa da extrema esquerda da linha exterior de cada jogados, casa a que chamam uté (cabeça).\r\n\r\nApós este arranjo, inicia-se o jogo, sem se considerarem as pedras e as casas da ou das colunas em que cada jogador tem mais do que duas pedras (no caso da figura 26, as casas A1,a1, A7,a7, B7, e b7; no da figura 27, as casas A1, a1, A7,a7, B1,b1, B7 e b7). Após ser comido o par inicial a um jogador, este começa o seu lanço pela casa com maior número de pedras (sempre a1 ou b7), distribuindo-as de forma usual, sem considerar as casas da coluna da outra extremidade, se nela houver um grupo de mais de duas pedras, deixando ficar uma pedra na casa de mão (excepção). Se houver ainda outro grupo inicial com mais de duas pedras, só será desfeito quando desparecem os pares desse parceiro. \r\nDepois de desfeitos os grupos inciais com mais de duas pedras designados por uté o jogo segue as regras gerais. \r\n\r\nJogadas— Podem ser movimentos compostos.\r\n\r\nComer— Segue a regra do Tchela.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariantes— É permoitifo fugir como no Tchela. As diversas disposições das pedras no início do jogo, propriamente dito, não se podem considerar como variantes. \r\n\r\nTradições— Não se conhecem.\r\n\r\nInterdições— Não se conhecem.\r\n\r\nPrática— Jogo de homens, praticamente só velhos o sabem jogar, não havendo, no entanto, qualquer proibição para os homens e para os rapazes.

The motive of the game is, by moving these stones in certain directions fixed by rule. to get them into positions relative to your opponent''s and so sweep them off the board. The skill lies in selecting your move so as to bring your men into the required position.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of the game: the following is a typical example of the kind named "natatu" ("the one of three"), so called because most holes contain three stones to start with.\r\n\r\nEach player has 33 stones, which he proceeds to place in the holes nearest to him—this is called "planting" (kushanga)— three in each hole, except the last four on his right hand in the second row which have 2, 1, 0, 0. They are now ready to start. They may move only in one direction: in the line nearest the player from right to left, in the farther row from left to right (This applies to the first move: in the second move the player may, if he chooses, reverse the direction, but if he does he must keep to it through the rest of the game.)...The opening move is called kubingula, subsequent moves kuteka ("to draw water"). The player selects the hole to move from; takes out the stones and drops them one by one in the following holes. The secret is to plan a move so as to leave the last of these stones in an otherwise empty hole, immediately opposite the opponent''s occupied hole. If he succeeds in this, he takes all directly opposite that hole: this is to "eat" (kudya); and he has also the right to remove all the stones in any other hole of his opponent: this is kusuwa ("to snacth")...\r\n\r\nAnother form of move is called kusuntula ("to lift up"). You drop the men in the holes as before, but having come to the end of those you hold you take out all the stones from the last hole you come to and drop them one by one in succeeding holes: you can continue this till your last stone drops into an empty hole. At times one sees a player going round the board, twice or even three times, dropping men in successive holes and taking them out. The do it so rapidly that it is difficult to see what they are doing...\r\n\r\nThe game is frequently lengthened by one or both players "passing in foreigners," as they say, kuisha Balumbu. When one is getting beaten he has this privilege of adding six or seven fresh stones to his depleted holes and continuing the game. His opponent may elect to do the same. But unless he does, the other may not enjoy the privilege in two successive games." Smith and Dale 1920: 232-237.\r\n', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

When the player sows from the leftmost hole in the outer row for the first time, they have the option of sowing first in that hole or in the next hole (the one in which sowing would normally occur). When a single counter exists in the penultimate hole in the inner row and the opponent is able to capture it on their next turn it can "skip" to either the first or second hole in the outer row, provided one of them is empty. This can only be done if the final hole in the inner row is empty. The initial phase ends for a player when they have one counter in each hole.

Among the Khasis the game is known as Máwkár kátiyá (=going round the slab or plank). It may be mentioned that though a wooden board in which rough circular and shallow depressions have been scooped out in two rows, the number of rows in each hole (sic) being seven, is generally used, sometimes specially on fair days, the game is played outside the house on stone slabs. Two persons are necessary for the play and, to start with, five small stones are kept within each depression. One of the players picks up the stones from a depression lying in the row just next to him and goes on putting one piece of stone into each depression. As soon as he has done with the five pieces he started with, he picks up all the stones lying immediately in front of the depression where the last piece was deposited. He must repeat this action till, after having deposited all the pieces that he may carry in his hand, he comes to an empty depression lying immediately in front of the one where the last piece was dropped. In this case all the pieces of stone lying within the depression immediately next to the vacant one will come into his possession and the other player will begin the game, following exactly the same method, each playing from right to left along his line of depressions and from left to right along the line of depressions belonging to his adversary. The players will thus keep on the game alternately till all the pieces have been removed from the plank, with the general result that one of the players is in possession of more than 35 pieces of stone and the other less. The game will now be started for the second time but not by the player who started it on the previous occasion and one peculiarity will be observed while arranging the pieces. Suppose, for example, that after the end of the first game, one player finds that he has 37 pieces in his possession, then he will arrange 35 pieces in the usual way, while two (I.e. the pieces he has obtained in excess of 35) will not be placed in any of the depressions, but will remain to his credit while the game is being played for the second time. The other player will now arrange the 33 pieces, placing 3 within the depression lying to the extreme left along his line, while the other six will contain 5 pieces each. On this occasion the following additional rules will also be observed:—\r\n\r\n(a) The person that has got two pieces extra will have all the single groups of two pieces that may accumulate within one depression while his adversary is playing to his credit. While the latter will have all the single groups of 3 pieces that may accumulate within one depression to his credit while the former may be playing.\r\n\r\n(b) The winner will have the depression to his extreme left covered by his palm and gain one piece every time he passes round this depression, while his adversary will not be allowed to drop any piece in it. \r\n\r\n(c) The pieces that will be gathered in the depression where the three pieces were placed will always come to the possession of the winner. \r\n\r\nThese rules will, certainly, vary according to the difference in the number of pieces possessed by each player after the end of any game. If we, for example, suppose that the winner has got 47 pieces after one game, then two depressions beginning from the right of his adversary along the row belonging to his adversary along the row belonging to his adversary will be kept covered over and none will be allowed to place any piece inside these. The games will be continued in this way and the person who succeeds in capturing all the pieces of his opponent will be victorious. It is clear that the rules of the game are a little complicated and as I had to obtain my information from an old Khasia woman with the help of an interpreter I would not be surprised if it was found that the rules enumerated above require correction. I sincerely hope that, as a result of the publication of this note, some better informed person may come forward and give us (possibly) a more correct and complete account of the game."

Neither player may begin sowing from the central holes. When sowing ends, if the next hole after the hole in which the final counter was placed is occupied, these counters are picked up and sown. If this hole is empty, the counters in the hole opposite it are captured. The player who captures the most pieces wins.\r\n', '"A similar game played in parts of Orissa is known as Kánji-guti. One hundred and forty-five pieces are required to play this game. One piece is kept within one depression of the central pair, while the other depression of this pair is kept empty and 12 pieces are placed within each of the remaining 12 depressions. As I gather from my Oorya servant, the rules of the game are mainly the same as are followed by the Khasis with some differences. In the case of the Orissa game one row of depressions does not belong to one player. During the first run of play no piece is to be dropped in that depression in which one piece was played at the beginning of the game. Then the rules observed by the Khasis are generally followed with the important exception that none will be able to play with the pieces lying with the central pair of depressions, I.e. they cannot be taken out of these depressions and dropped in the succeeding ones but the pieces lying within the central pair can be captured like the pieces lying in the others. In the Orissa type the pieces are moved from left to right and the player who captures more pieces at the end of each game is the winner, and the result of one game is not carried over to the next to finish what may be called a set."

The game ends when one player no longer has any counters on their side of the board. The opponent then captures the remaining counters on the board.

Subsequent games are played until one player captures all of the holes, becoming the winner.', '"These comparative questions will be taken up later, after the following description. I was taught to play the game by Molan Baia, a man in his fifties and a leading elder of his clan, Laong Hodiq, who was one of my most constant companions and closest friends. This happened early in my second year, at a time when the larger connections in the culture, which had until then remained hidden to me, began to make\r\ntheir appearance; and indeed the discovery of motiq, as the game is called, was an early impulse toward the coalescing of my understanding of K?dang culture. For several weeks then the village was slightly amused watching Molan and myself, as well as whoever else joined in,\r\nsquatting in the dust and deeply engaged in a game that was a little less than suited to our customary dignity.\r\nThe general name for the game is motiq. I do not know if this word has any other meaning. The general phrase for play of any kind, huang,\r\nis not connected directly with the game. To play this game is pan motiq,\r\nand pan means "to travel" or "move", a phrase not far removed in\r\nmeaning from the Arabic manqala. Motiq is played in two versions, each with a name of its own. The first and more common version is\r\nka ia or "eat fish". Here there are two parallel lines of seven holes each, and the game starts with four stones (or seeds) in each hole. These\r\nholes are either dug in the ground, or (as one occasionally, but very rarely, sees) the game may be played on a board in which holes are cut.\r\nThere are two players, and each player owns the holes in the row closest to him. Each row represents a human body and each hole is associated\r\nwith a part of the body, as in figure 1. The object of play is to capture stones. They are moved from hole to hole circularly through the rows, always in a counter-clockwise direction according to the native injunction to travel to the right, wana\r\npan. It is never allowed to reverse this direction. A player may begin\r\nwith any hole on his own side, but never with a hole in the opponent''s\r\nrow. He picks up the stones in one hole and distributes them, one each, in the next four. He then takes the five stones in the last of these holes\r\nand distributes them one by one in the next five, and so on. Eventually, it begins to be possible to end with one''s last stone in a group of three.\r\nWhen this occurs, the player takes all four and sets them aside as his winnings before continuing play.\r\nIt works out mathematically that the first to move always ends his play in the hole from which he started. He picks up four stones and puts them one each in the next consecutive holes. He then picks the five\r\nin the last hole and lays them down. Again he picks up five and lays them down. Four plus five plus five equal fourteen, and the last stone lands in the hole from which he began. Since this hole is empty before this last stone is placed there, he cannot pick up the stones in it; his\r\nhand is empty and he is mat?, "dead". It is then the opponent''s turn. This first play leaves two empty holes. Already at this point an experienced player may exercise strategy in his play. If the opponent\r\npicks up the stones just behind one of these empty holes, he will eventually (after several rounds) gain four stones on two occasions, and his play will then end. However, he will leave one hole for the first\r\nplayer containing nine stones, and if these are picked up, the first player will, after a much longer series, himself capture the stones in two holes. These are mathematical certainties, which all experienced players know\r\nabout. The whole exchange can be prevented if on the very first play of the game, the first player takes the stones from the "head" hole because the relevant empty hole will land on his side. It will, in fact, be the "shin" hole. The hole right behind it, (his "foot") will also be on his side, so his opponent will not be allowed to start there.\r\nWhen a player''s last stone lands in a group of three and he captures all four, the player is said to ka ia, "eat fish". He gets, figuratively, a meal of fish. Consequently, when a group of three appears during\r\nthe play they attract attention as ia, "fish", which potentially may be\r\n"eaten" before they are covered up by the play; i.e., before the player with more than the requisite number of stones in his hand fills it up by\r\nadding a stone in passing beyond it. Although in this case it has four, it is not won by the player because he must play beyond it, and it becomes closed like other holes with any number of stones other than three: it is for the time being no longer a potential fish.\r\nThe player who is fortunate enough to land with a final stone in a hole with a group of three, and thus "eats fish", then, after setting aside\r\nhis winnings, takes the stones in the next consecutive hole and plays on until he too lands with a final stone in an empty hole and is dead. The turn changes, and the game proceeds by alternating turns in\r\nthis way.\r\nEventually the stones will begin to be scarce and the point will be\r\nreached where the players are in danger of moving their few stones on to the opponent''s side without having any left on their own. This marks the beginning of the end game. The strategy at this point becomes to\r\nmove the stones which by chance are on one''s side as slowly as possible, hoping to force the opponent to move all of his stones on to one''s own side before moving any more on to his. One hopes simultaneously to\r\navoid the same fate. This stage is usually of short duration and one or the other soon fails. All stones remaining on the board are the winnings\r\nof the player who can hold out longest.\r\nThis round of the game is then over. The players count the stones\r\nthey have won to see who has the most. Unless they are both even (i.e., twenty-eight to a side), there is always an advantage which is a multiple of four. Four stones represent a hole. The player on the\r\ndisadvantage loses, for the next round, the number of holes correspond ing to the quotient of the number of stones he is behind divided by four. In short, one loses and gains holes, not stones.\r\nAt each new play, the opening player is the one who was second in the previous set. The play begins again with (except in the event of\r\na tie) one player with fewer, one with more, holes. The holes gained or lost are removed from the foot end. The last consecutive hole gained becomes the new head for the more fortunate player. All fourteen holes are always in play, with one player gaining more, another losing, holes.\r\nThe two figures then shrink and expand according to the fortunes of the play; i.e., they become shorter or taller. It gives one a tactical advantage in the play to have more holes; for one can only begin with a hole in one''s own territory and in the play one chooses to start from that hole which promises to be most productive. Although it is possible to recover ground, the more one falls behind the more difficult it becomes to maintain one''s position. If after several rounds, one player\r\nis able to consume the opponent''s territory to the point of capturing his head, the game is finished. As can be seen the game can be absorbingly interesting, and an\r\nexperienced player will learn to recognize certainties in the probable\r\ncourse of the play according to the way the stones lie, in the same way\r\nthat an experienced cribbage player no longer needs to count the cards in his hand but knows what it is worth and what can be done with it\r\nat a glance."

If a player can bring three of their sticks in a row, they may then remove one of the opponent''s sticks. The player who can no longer play loses.', '"2. Dala \r\n\r\nThis game is played by all Baggara tribes. I learnt it from the Homr and have seen it played by the Rizeigat. It is very much more difficult than Sîja, to play well, and is fully as worthy as draughts of the attention of European players. \r\n\r\nDar Homr contains very little sand and no stone at all, so Dâla is played on a raised board made of soft mud, divided into six rows of six squares, marked by holes, and the counters, of which each player has twelve, take the form of sharpened sticks, about six inches long. Those of one player are distinguished by removal of the bark, which is left on those of the other player.\r\n\r\nThe holes are called Nugâr (sing., Nûgara) and the sticks ''Îdân (sing. ''Ûd). The players set the board by sticking in their sticks (tchakka is the verb) one at a time, alternately, the rule being that the four middle holes of the board must be filled, after which a player may place his stick in any vacant hole he likes. The diagram, Fig. 2, shows a possible distribution of the twenty-four sticks on the board. Here, again, the setting of the board is done with a view to, and largely determines, the subsequent line of play amd there is room for a high degree of skill in doing it. \r\n\r\nThe rule is that the two players make alternate moves. If a move brings three of the player''s sticks into line and adjacent to each other, or (if four of the sticks were previously in line and adjacent) leaves three in line and adjacent, then the player can remove from the board any one of his opponent''s sticks which he may select. \r\n\r\nThis bringing of sticks into line and the resulting removal of one of the opponent''s sticks is called a ta''na. Thus, in fig. 2, by moving the stick X1 into line with X2 and X3 the player makes a ta''na and can remove any one of the sticks ).\r\n\r\nIf a player gets five sticks into the positions indicated in Fig. 3 he is said to have a "bull" which yields a ta''na every time he moves the stick X1 up or down, and, if it is beyond the opponent''s power to break up the bull, he mocks him, saying "Dejj! Tsp tsp, tsp, tsp, tsp —" these being the sounds the herdsboy makes to cause a bull to lead a herd straight ahead. Tactful remarks to a defeated opponent, in fact, are no part of the Homrawi convention. When the issue is no longer in doubt, for instance, he will pronounce the jingle "Jebbid Hateibak: Biga li''eibak"—"Pull up your little sticks: your game''s up."

If the player captures counters in a hole, then they may also capture counters in the previous hole, if it also has 2,4, or 6, continuing until reaching a hole without 2, 4, or 6. Play continues until one player cannot play on their turn, at which point the other player receives all of the remaining counters. The player with the most captured counters wins.', '"Das Bohnenspiel, dieses uralte, höchst originelle und interressante, völlig in Vergessenheit geratene Brettspiel habe ich auf einer Besuchsreife in den baltischen Provinzen bei Herrn Baron von Stackelberg 1908 in Kardis wiederentdeckt.

Gerade heute, während ich hier auf das Bohnenspiel zu sprechen komme, hat mir Frau Oberpräsident von Waldow in Stettin ein Bohnenspiel aus ihrer kindheit gezeigt, das genau dem baltischem entspright; nur ist das deutsche Bohnenspiel besteht, wie aus der obigen Abbildung ersichtlich ist, aus einem sauber gearbeitenen Spielbrett mit 2x6 sich gegenüberliegenden, eingearbeiteten Bohnenschalen und je einer Gewinnmulde zur rechten Hand der beiden Bohnenspieler.

And once he has captured one of the others [if they begin with ten], they cannot trap him. But if there were twelve,by capturing one eleven remain, and they can carry him with them wherever thy want.

Acting Consul-General in Korea.\r\nKorean chess, Tjyang-keid (Chinese, tseungk''i) is admittedly a variant of Chinese, yet, as will be seen, there are some important differences be- tween the two games. The design of the board, but not its shape, is the same, save that in Korea the files are carried across the " river," which is, in fact, ignored. The men, again, have the same names as in China, and, except that the King is placed in the centre of his " camp," and that the " Horse" and " Elephant" are interchangeable, occupy the same positions at starting. But their powers and privileges in most cases differ largely. A Korean chess-board and men, arranged for a game, is represented in Fig. 93. It will be noticed that the board is not square, but oblong, the width being greater than the breadth. All the Korean chess.-boards have this shape, the object in view being to facilitate the moving of pieces when they have reached the opponent''s end of the board. It may be observed, in passing, that chess-boards would seem to be all of domestic manufacture, as they are not sold in any shops, even at the capital. The men can be procured, though they are usually made to order, inclosed in a net resembling an onion bag.\r\nAnother feature in which the Korean game will be seen to differ out- wardly from the Chinese is the shape of the men and the circumstances that the hieroglyphics on one side are inscribed in the " grass character," or running hand. Korean chessmen are not circular, as in China, but octagonal,^ and vary in size according to their value, the King (General) being the largest, the Chariot, Elephant, Horse and Cannon of medium size and the Pawns (soldiers) and Counsellors the smallest. The hiero- glyphs on one side are usually colored red, on the other green—the draughtsmen, for such in appearance they are, being all of the same wood and undyed. In describing the powers of the pieces, it will be convenient to give each its corresponding Western name, the Hpo, a piece we unfortunately lack, being styled a Cannon. The Korean names are as follows\r\n1. Tjyang (Chinese, tseung), " General," more usually called Koung (Chinese, kiin), " Palace," the King.\r\n2. Tcka (Chinese,M), "Chariot, "Rook.\r\n3. Hpo (Chinese), p''du), "Cannon."\r\n4. Pyeng (Chinese, ping), or tjol (Chinese, tsut), " Foot-soldier," Pawn. 5. Sd (Chinese, sz''), "Counsellor, "Queen.\r\n6. Syang{ OamtsG, tseung),"Elephant,"Bishop.\r\n7. Ma (Chinese, ma), " Horse," Knight.\r\nThe moves of these pieces follow two general laws, the existence of\r\nwhich makes Korean chess a more finished or more logical game than the Chinese. The first is that the pieces invariably take as they move ; the second, that, within their limitations, they move along any marked line. In Chinese chess the P''du moves like a Rook, but takes only when a piece intervenes ; the Korean Cannon moves and takes in the same way. On the Chinese board the files between the fifth and sixth ranks are not marked, in order to better indicate the " river," after the crossing of which the Pawns acquire increased powers; yet for the purposes of play they exist. The diagonal lines joining the corners of the General''s " camp " may be, though they seldom are, omitted from a Chinese chess-board ; but neither they nor the river files must be left out on the Korean. For, as has been said, wherever a line is marked a Korean piece can, within its limitations, move along it. Thus the Chariot, which has precisely the same powers as our Rook, may move from one corner of the " camp " to the centre, or, if so desired, to the corner diagonally opposite, because those points are connected by a marked line. For the same reason the Cannon, if on one such corner, may, when the centre is occupied, hop over to the opposite corner along the line of the diagonal. A similar train of reason- ing has made identical the movements of the two Counsellors and the General.\r\nThe General, or King, as he shall be called, may move from his original position at the centre on to any one of the nine points in his camp, but he can never leave his camp. Within it he moves only one step at a time, and that only along marked lines. Thus, if the King were at 5 a he could move thence to 5 b (the centre), 6 a or 4 a, but he could not move to 4 b or 6 b, because there is no line connecting 5 a with these last two points. As in the Chinese game, the Kings check one another across the board if they are on the same file, with no piece intervening. Korean chess, however, leans here, as in other games, toward the losing side. If one of the players has an overpowering advantage the other is allowed, should opportunity occur, to check his opponent''s King with his own.Thus, if Red has King on 6 i, Pawns on 3 d and 6d, while Green has King on 5a, Rook on 7a, Pawn on 7d, Red is allowed to play King 6i to 5i (check). When Green moves his King to 4 a or 6 a (his only alternatives), Red again checks with his King, making the game a draw. It should, how- ever, be observed that the act of checking the opponent''s King with one''s own is in itself a confession of inferiority, and deprives the player of any chance of winning the game,—he can at most draw it.''\r\nThe King on the losing side is allowed yet another privilege. If he is the only piece on his side, and if his moving would greatly endanger him, he is allowed, as the equivalent of a move, to turn over and remain in his original position...The Counsellors, or Queens, move in all respects like the King, and are equally confined to the nine points of the camp. They cannot give check, however, across the board. They are more powerful than the Chinese Ss'', which can only occupy the five points on the diagonals.\r\nThe Chariots, or Rooks, have exactly the powers of our own Castles, or the Chinese Kii, except that, as has been said, they can also move along the marked diagonals of either their own or the enemy''s camp.\r\nThe Horses (Knights) have precisely the move of the Chinese Md, which is also that of the Western Knight, with one important limitation. The Korean and the Chinese Md always moves first one step along a file or rank, and then a step diagonally. If there be a piece, whether of his own side or the enemy''s, at the elbow, so to speak, of his beat, he cannot move. Thus in the example given above, the Red Knight on 3 c could not move to 5b or 5d, because of the Pawn on 4c; had the Pawn been on 4b or 4 the Knight would not be stopped. It will be seen that it is, owing to this rule, possible to cover check- from a Korean Knight.\r\nThe Elephant, or Bishop, moves one step along a rank or file, then two steps diagonally. It differs from the Jafna/ or Camel of Tamerlane''s Chess, in that the latter moves first a step diagonally, and then two straight wise, and has, which the Syang has not, the privilege of vaulting. For the Korean Elephant must have a clear course from start to finish, like the Chinese Elephant. Unlike the latter (whose move is that of Tamerlane''sF il, or the original Bishop, the Fil less their power of vaulting), the Korean Elephant is not confined to its own side of the river, but may move freely all over the board.\r\nAt starting, the Korean Bishop must stand on one of the two points between the Rook and the Queen, the Knight being placed on the other; but on which point depends upon the whim of the player. Perhaps it would be simpler to say that at the commencement of the game, the men being arranged as in Chinese chess (except that the Kings are on 5 b, not 5 a, and 5 i, not 5 j, either player may, before moving, but not afterward, interchange Knight or Bishop at one or both sides of his Hne. If one player so inter- changes, it is generally considered advisable for the other to do the same, but he is under no obligation in the matter.\r\nThe Soldiers (Pawns) differ from those of China in that they have from the first the move which the Chinese Ping only gets after crossing the river. A Korean Pawn moves one step sideways or forward, but never backward or diagonally. When he reaches his tenth rank (the enemy''s first) he does not change his condition, but remains a Pawn, restricted to a sidelong movement up and down that rank. For this reason a Pawn is not often advanced to the last line—is, indeed, seldom carried beyond the eighth rank, his strongest position. We have seen that, in common with the Rook, the King, and Queen, the Pawn can travel along the diagonal of the camp.\r\nThe Cannon differs from the P''du of China in that it moves as it takes, and that another Cannon can neither form a " Screen " for it nor be taken by it. The Korean Hpo moves in a straight line, horizontally or perpendicularly, but only when some piece (not itself a Cannon) intervenes."

A player cannot jump a man over an occupied point to put it on a blank one beyond, and there is no taking or crowning of men, it is simply a question of blocking your opponent.

This is also done on subsequent occasions, when required by similar circumstances. The aim of each party, after the first disposal of the kelbs, is to place any one of his kelbs in such a situation that there shall be, between it and another of his, one of his adversary''s kelbs. This, by so doing, he takes ; and as long as he can immediately make another capture by such means, he does so, without allowing his adversary to move. --These are the only rules of the game.

In his cyclic sequence the cup F is followed by cup a, and the cup f by cup A...\r\n\r\nWhen p plays he empties any one of the cups abcdef and deals round its contents according to the same cycle...\r\n\r\n(ii) P wins pebbles by his dealing when (and only when) the last pebble falls into one of p''s cups abcdef and, there falling, makes 2 or 3 pebbles in that cup. He then captures the 2 or 3 (whichever it is) and places them with his winnings in cup Z. Similarly p captures 2 or 3 pebbles from one of P''s cups ABCDEF when the last pebble he deals produces a 2 or 3 when it falls in the cup...\\\r\n\r\n(iii) Captiures by P may consist of any number (up to six) of 2''s and 3''s, provided only that they are in consecutive cups of p''s, and that the last of the series of cups receives the last marble dropped. That is, when P captures a 2 or 3 from one of p''s cups he captures also the contents of the next cup of p''s to his (P''s) right if that also has become a 2 or 3; and so on for as many 2''s and 3''s are consecutive...Captures by p, similarly, are made from P''s cups only, and consist of 2''s and 3''s consecutive with the 2 or 3 captured from the last cup...\r\n\r\n(iv) A heavily loaded cup may in the course of play accumulate 12 or more pebbles, and the playing of this cupful will give a deal making more than one complete cycle of the board. For the cup emptied is always to be left empty. The cycle of cups which receive, by dealing, the contents of the cup emptied are therefore in effect the 11 cups remaining after the omission of the one emptied...\r\n\r\n(v) An exception to P''s free choice of any one of his own cups, from which to play its contents, occurs when p''s cups are all empty. If P is able to play from a cup which feeds pebbles into p''s cups he must do so: he may not play a cup which does not reach p''s cups. If, however, no move of P plays pebbles into p''s cups, then P captures the whole contents of his own cups...Similarly for player p. When P''s cups are empty p must, if possible, play so as to feed P''s cups; and if p cannot do so he captures the whole contents of his own cups. \r\n\r\nIf p''s cups are empty and it is p''s own turn to play (p''s cups having just been cleared by P), then also P becomes owner of the total contents of his own cups...Similarly for P, with empty cups after p has just played; the contents of p''s cups become p''s. \r\n(vi) When very few pebbles remain in play it may happen that they circulate in a cyclic and periodic chase with no captures possible for either player.

It is usually played by four persons, each of whom is furnished with four ivory or wooden cones (called got or gottee) of a peculiar color for distinction, and takes his station opposite one of the rectangles.

Their motion is determined by throwing of six or seven cowries (I.e. shells) as dice, which count according as the apertures fall uppermost or not; one aperture up, counts 10; two, 2; three, 3; four, 4; five, 25; six, 30; seven, 12; and if none be turned up, it counts 6. A throw of 25 or 30 gives an additional move of 1. At the last step the throw must account exactly to one more than the number of squares ledt to enable the piece to go into the central space; that is, as we would say, off the board. If it happen to stop on the last square, therefore, it cannot get off until you throw a 25 or 30. The players throw in turns, and each goes on until he throws a 2, 3, or 4, when he loses the lead.

This popular Indian game may be played by two, three, or four persons, and twelve counters are used, called Kay in Tamil and Sar in Hindustani; and also coloured red, yellow, black, and green, in sets of three. Blue being an unlucky colour is never used for counters in any game. If there be only two players each takes six counters. They are more or less dagaba-shaped, like those previously described. The board, called Silei, ''the cloth'' in Tamil, is like that used for Pahada Keliya, and is always worked on cloth or velvet (Fig. 264). Crosses are marked on the fifth outer squares from the central enclosure, and on the fourth squares if the middle rows. In these squares the counters cannot be ''struck'' by the opponents; they are termed Chira. The ordinary squares are called ''House'' (ghara, Hind. or vidu, Tamil), and the central enclosure is the char-koni (hind.), ''the Square.'' Six cowry shells are thrown as dice, after being shaken in the closed hands. The score is as follows:—When all the mouths are upward it counts 12, barah; if five mouths be upward it is 25, pachis; if two, three, or four mouths be upward the score is 2, do; 3, tin; and 4, char, respectively. If only one mouth be upward the score is 10, das; and when no mouth is upward it counts 6, choka. Whenever 10 or 25 is thrown the player has another throw, abd if at the second throw one of the same numbers fall it counts accordingly, that is, another 10 or 25. But if either of these numbers be thrown a third time consecutively nothing is counted, and this throw cancels the two previous throws of 10 or 25, the score of the whole three throws being now 0. The right to have an additional throw would still remain, and the score would then begin afresh. There are also additional throws after 6 or 12 has fallen. To begin the game, each player throws the shells in his turn in the right-hand order; until he obtains a 10 or 25 his counters cannot enter the board. Whenever either of these two numbers is thrown it is called a ''win'' and an addition of 1 is made to the score. If the player have counters awaiting entry or re-entry at the time, this extra allowance must always be expended in paying for one of them, 1 being charged for the entry or re-entry of each counter. If all be in the game the extra 1 is added to the rest of the score; thus a throw of 10 is counted as 11, and 25 is reckoned as 26. Excepting that this extra may be used separately, the amount of each throw cannot be subdivided among different counters. In the case of the additional throw of the shells after a throw of 6, 10, 12, or 25, the amounts of the two throws may be used separately, without subdivision—either to bring a counter into an opponent''s square so as to ''strike'' his counters, and then move onward to the extent of the other part of the score; or the tow parts may be employed in moving forward two counters. The counters are not blocked as in Pahada Keliya. As they pass down the middle row on their way into the central enclosure they are aid on their sides to distinguish them from counters that may be moving outwards. To enter the central enclosure the exact number required must be thrown. If the counter be in the last square this can only be obtained by throwing 10 or 25, the extra score of 1 which either of these receives being utilised for the purpose."

One such game is, however, known to them. It is a form of draughts known as terhüchü—"Fighting-eating," because the pieces of the opposing side fight and eat one another up. The board is a square one of sixteen squares (Fig. 1) joined by diagonal lines and usually scratched roughly on a large stone, cut into planking, or merely drawn in the earth. The pieces, which are bits of stone, move obliquely or straight along the lines, one going the distance of one square only at a time unless they are able to "eat" one of their opponents by jumping over him into an empty station beyond. As a rule, there are ten pieces on each side, but the game is sometimes played with eight, in which case the two outside stations of the forward line are left empty. A variant form is played with nine pieces on each side, the pieces being set out as shown in the diagram (Fig II). In this form there are triangular refuges into which and in which pieces may move along any of the lines shown. Inside these corners the piece may skip one junction of lines and move straight to the next but one.

Sija. this is not specially a nomad Arab game—in fact, it is more commonly played in towns than in the desert—but it seems to be a basic game, widely known in Africa, from which local variants are derived. It is played on a board of twenty-five squares (I.e. five rows of five hollows scooped in the sand), each player having twelve counters known as dogs (I.e. twelve pieces of stone for one player and twelve pieces of brick, or other distinguishable matter, for the other). The counters are not set out on the board in a predesignated order, but the player who wins the toss places two "dogs" where he likes, the only restriction being that the middle square of the board must be left vacant. His opponent then "throws" two counters into any unoccupied squares other than the middle one, and so on, alternately, until the board, except for the middle square, is full, as shown in the diagram. This "throwing" is of course done with an eye to the succeeding play and is important as the deal at Bridge. Play is continued by the winner of the toss moving one of his counters into the middle square. If, thereby, he can bring one of his opponent''s "dogs" between two of his own, he "eats" it, I.e. removes it from the board. In the diagram, as shown, by moving the coutner ) to the middle square, the player "eats" both X1 and X2. His opponent then moves, "eating" or not, as he is able, and so on, alternately, until one has completely destroyed the "dogs" of the other and is therefore the winner.

And the other sixteen of the other colour are to be arranged on the other end of the board in that same way, opposite the others.And of these sixteen pieces eight are lesser, because they were made to resemble the common people who go in the army.\nAnd of the other pieces which are greater one resembles the king, who is the lord of the army and he should be in one of the two middle squares.2\nAnd next to him in the other middle square, is another piece which resembles the fers (alfferez) who carries the standard of the king’s colours. And there are some men who do not know the name and call him “fersa” (alfferza).3 And these two pieces each one plays alone and does not have another in all the sixteen pieces that resembles them.\nAnd in the two other squares beside these there are two other pieces which resemble each other and they call them fils (alffiles) in Arabic which means the same thing in our language as elephants, which the kings used to bring into battle and each one brought at least two so if one of them died, that the other one would remain.\nAnd in the other two squares next to these there are two other pieces which resemble each other and everyone commonly calls them horses but their proper names are knights, which are placed as captains by order of the king, for the purpose of leading the ranks of the army.\nAnd in the other two squares on the end [f. 3v] there are two other pieces which also resemble each other and they call them rooks and they are made wide and stretched because they resemble the ranks of the soldiers.\nIn the first rank are the major pieces that we said and in the second the pawns. And even though there are nine pieces in terms of squares, there are not more than six counting that they are doubled.\nBecause the fils and the knights and the rooks which are six, become three and with the king and the fers and the pawns, which each count as one, they make six. And they put them thus doubled so that when one of them is captured, that another of that type remains to give check and mate to the king or to shelter him.\nAlso they provided for the fers that when he should be lost, any one of the pawns managing to arrive at the furthest square on the opposite side of the board, where the major pieces begin, from then on they would be ferses and could play just like the former and move in that way. And this is because they rise from the status of the lesser pieces to that of the greater ones.\nThe king they made so that he could not be captured but that they could give him check in order that they could make him leave from that space which he held, as though dishonoured. And if they cornered him so that he did not have anywhere to go, they named it checkmate which is the same as dead and this they did in order to shorten the game. Because it would become verylengthy if all the pieces were to be captured until only the two kings remained alone or the one of them.\nChapter on the movement of the chess pieces\nThe movement of the pieces was established also for this reason that we will tell you, because just as the king should not rush into battles but go very slowly and gaining always from the enemies and fighting so as to beat them, likewise the king of the chessmen is not to move more than one square straight or diagonally as one who looks all around him meditating on what he is to do.\nThe fers moves one square diagonally and this is in order to guard the king and not leave his side and to shield him from the checks and checkmates when they are given to him and in order to go forward helping him to win when the game comes out well.\nBut he can also on his first move jump to the second4 straight or diagonal square and even if another piece is in between. And this is in the manner of a good captain who charges ahead in great feats and battles and rushes everywhere they need him. And in this movement he joins forces with his foot soldiers and becomes one with them as if forcing them not to leave his side and to be as one in order to do the best thing and thus he guards himself and them, having some before him and standing before the others. And therefore when the fers is thus joined with the pawns, they call it flanked.5\nThe fils jump to the second6 diagonal square like the elephants that the kings used to bring at that time because no one dared to stand in front of them and the ones who were on them made them move diagonally to wound the ranks of their enemies so that they were not able to guard themselves.\nThe knights jump three square counting one7 straight and taking the third diagonally in any direction. And this is like the good captains who lead the ranks turning their horses to the right and to the left in order to guard their men and conquer the enemies.\nThe rooks play straight as far as they can move before them or behind or to the right or to the left. And this is like the ranks of the soldiers which go forward as far as they can or in whichever direction they understand will be best in order to more quickly be able to conquer those with whom they are fighting.\n[f. 4] The pawns do not go more than one square straight ahead of them like the foot soldiers of the army, they cannot move very far because they go on foot and they carry their weapons and the other things that they need on their backs.But there are also some that play the pawns to the second8 square on their first move and this is until they capture because afterwards they cannot do it. And this is like when the common people steal some things, that they carry them on their backs.\nChapter on how the chess pieces capture\nThe pieces’ capturing each other is in this manner.\nThe king captures in all the squares that we said he could go, any piece from the other side which is there unless there is some other piece from the other side of that piece which shelters it.\nAnd the other major pieces do that same thing like the fils and the knights and the rooks but the fers cannot capture on the first move if it is played going to the second9 square but after it is played it will capture in the second diagonal square according to its movement.\nThe pawns also, even though they can move to the second10 square on the first move if they want, they cannot capture in it but rather they capture diagonally moving forward one square. And this is like the foot soldiers who cannot wound each other being faced off straight in front each other, but he wounds the other who is to his diagonal because he does not guard against him as much."\n\n', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, NULL),

The fifth hole from the left in the inner row is rectangular, the rest are circular. 64 counters. Play begins with one counter in each hole in the inner row. Players take turns placing their remaining counters on the board in their inner rows. When they place a counter, they capture the hole facing it in the opponent''s inner row, and sows the counters from either the leftmost or the rightmost hole of the player''s inner row, sowing along the inner row. However, if the capture occurs from the rightmost, leftmost, or the next hole adjacent to each in the inner row, the captured pieces must be placed in the leftmost or rightmost hole, whichever is closer. The player may choose which hole to place captured counters in when captures are made from the central four holes in the inner row. If a player cannot capture in this way, they can place a counter into any of the holes in their inner row, pick up the contents of that hole, and sow in either direction. While sowing, if the final counter falls into an occupied hole and the opponent''s hole opposite it has counters, the counters in the opponent''s hole are captured. If the final counter falls into an occupied hole and the hole opposite it is empty, the counters are picked up and sowing continues in the same direction. If the final counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If during this phase, the opponent''s inner row is cleared of counters, the player wins. If all of the counters have been introduced and both players still have counters in their inner row, play proceeds to a second phase. Second Phase: Counters are picked up from any hole on the player''s side and sown in either direction. The same capture, sowing, and victory rules apply as before.

Total of 64 counters. Starting position: in the inner row, the first four holes, number of counters from the right: 0; 2; 2; 6. Play begins with each player alternately introducing the remaining counters in their holes. Each is introduced in such a way as to capture an opponent''s counters, by placing it into an occupied hole which is opposite one of the opponent''s occupied inner-row holes. The opponent''s counters are then captured and sown along the inner row from either the leftmost or rightmost hole. If the capture occurs in the rightmost or leftmost holes in the inner row, or the hole immediately adjacent to them in the inner row, the counters must be sown from the leftmost or rightmost hole (whichever is closest), and sown along the inner row. Captures on these subsequent sowings happen according to the same rules as in the second phase, with certain exceptions explained below. If no capture is available, a counter may be placed in any occupied hole in the inner hole except the square hole, and sows them in either direction. If the square hole is the only occupied hole in the inner row, the counter is placed there and the player sows only two seeds from it in either direction. If a loaded square hole is reduced to six counters, the player places a counter there and sows the entire contents, forfeiting the special status fo this hole for the rest of the game. Moves that start without a capture on the first sowing which end in the square hole stops there without further sowing. Sowing cannot start from a square hole except to capture, except as described above. If a sowing from an initial capturing move ends in an occupied square hole and no capture is possible, the player may choose to stop there or continue to sow. Once the contents of this hole have been relayed or captured the square hole loses its special status and the player may not introduce a counter into hole with one counter if there are other holes in the inner row containing multiple counters. One all of the counters are introduced, second phase starts. Players move by sowing seeds from a player''s holes. Sowing can happen in any direction, but must continue in that direction throughout the turn except in the special cases below. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the inner row and there are counters in the opponent''s hole in the inner row opposite, these are captured. The captured counters are placed in the leftmost or rightmost hole of the inner row and sown along the inner row. The leftmost or rightmost hole is chosen based on which continues the sowing direction of the move that made the capture. If the capture occurs in the rightmost or leftmost holes in the inner row, or the hole immediately adjacent to them in the inner row, the counters must be sown from the leftmost or rightmost hole (whichever is closest), and sown along the inner row, even if this incurs a change of direction. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole and a capture is not possible, the counters are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. A player must make a capturing move on their initial sowing if it is available. If a capturing move is not possible on the first sowing, no captures can be made on subsequent sowings in that turn. The game is won when the opponent''s inner row is cleared of counters.\n', 'Extensive ethnography of Bao Kiswahili in Lamu, Kenya, including the rules, its social import, and relationship to other mancala games.

Instead, many villages were seen to have a board owned by the community. The board was often found near the local mosque or central square (see Photo 1a). On late afternoons, players would gather to play and take turns, the loser of a game usually giving up his seat. Teenage boys would only play when the men were absent. No women were seen to play and privately-owned boards were rare. In one village, Foumbouni, it was considered inappropriate to play on the public square during Ramadhan but some players of this village who happened to have a privately-owned board were happy to demonstrate a few games on a bench near their house (see Photo 1b). The wooden boards always showed four rows of holes but the characteristic square holes in the center of the board were not always present. Also, storage holes were only optionally found on the far end of the board (see Photo 1c). The players used Caesalpinia bon- duc seeds like the ones used by players of Bao elsewhere on the East African coast.\nThe rules of the game have been described in detail by de Villeneuve(2003:8–19) but they are notoriously complex to describe in full (see Town- shend 1986; de Voogt 1995:35–43). The rules on Grande Comore did not differ significantly from those attested, for instance, on Madagascar, Zanz- ibar, or those known for Tanzania and Kenya. Some specific variations can be attested that often have to do with the level of the player or the circum- stances of play. For instance, the complex rule known in Swahili as takasia (Townshend 1986:118, de Voogt 1995:41–43) was only vaguely familiar to most and did not have a name. Only one expert player was able to give some details about its application in the game. Endless moves (see Kro- nenburg, Donkers & de Voogt 2006) were a loss for the player who started one, according to one player, but this would be a difficult rule to enforce.

A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player''s turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent''s hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it if their last counter falls into it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent''s captured hole, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player''s holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by p[lacing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent''s holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra they draw lots to see who gets an extra hole. Play then begins again as before. The game ends when one player owns all of the counters, and thus all of the holes. If toward then end of the game, when a player has been reduced to a single hole and it is captured by the opponent, the opponent captures the four counters involved in the capture. The hole remains in the possession of its owner, and is able to utilise any pieces falling into that hole on subsequent turns, but may also capture from this hole as though the hole had been captured by the opponent.\n', '"This game played by Qala Ab is based on two rows of holes, with four balls or counters per hole, and is strikingly similar to the gabata of central Ethiopia...The game would begin by one of the players picking up the entire contents of any of his holes, known in Bilén as bét, literally "house." Moving always in an anti-clockwise direction he would then drop these balls one by one in the following holes, his own or his opponent''s, and, on dropping the last counter he held in his hand, would pick up the contents of the hole in which it fell. He would continue in this manner,  dropping and taking up balls, until he reached an empty hole. There he would stop, and it would be the other player''s turn to play. The two players, moving alternately and invariably in an an anti-clockwise direction, would continue in this way, known in Bilén as ekwarna, literally "a child is born to me." Such a capture would be effected by dropping the last ball in any hand into an enemy hole containing three balls which would thus be increased to four. A player could not take from his own ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last counter of any hand into one of his own captured holes might say lagadi yekura in Bilén, literally "grow up, my child!", or sata waleya in Tigré, literally, "drink, my child!" When, on the other hand, a player alighted with the last ball of his hand on an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would take, or "eat," one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings, usually by placing them in a larger hole at the end of the board. He would then continue with his move by picking up the contents of any of his holes, and moving them in the normal way. The process of capturing from an ekwarna is known as qunna in Bilén or bela''e in Tigré. A player''s ownership of an ekwarna continued even if it became empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole belonged to the player who captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any hand there would put this counter aside as his takings. A player left without counters in any of his holes other than those captures as ekwarna would be unable to move. In such case his opponent would effect one or more additional moves, but the incapacitated player would resume play if and when balls came into any of his free holes. The round would finally come to an end when all the counters were captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players would then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had one extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with three who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end of the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. The game, often after a series of rounds, would eventually end with one of the players gaining a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes....Towards the end of the game when a player had been reduced to the ownership of only a single hole which was then captured as ekwarna by his opponent the latter was obliged to put aside as his takings the four counters involved in the capture. The hole in question was thus left in the possession of its former owner who would be able to utilise all counters subsequently falling there and would moreover be entitled to "eat" from that hole, as would have been the case earlier in the game with any other ekwarna."

The game of ||Hus (holes) is played under that name by the [Nama] and Berg Damaras of South-West Africa, and under the name Otjitoto (also meaning holes) by the Hereros or Cattle Damaras. The Berg Damaras and Hereros are said to have learned the game from the [Nama]. The writer has heard it stated that the same game is played by the Ovambos inhabiting the extreme northern portion of South-West Africa, but has not succeeded in obtaining any definite information on this\npoint. The rules of ||Hus are briefly described by Leonhard Schultze in his\nadmirable work Aus Namaland und Kalahari, but so far as the writer is aware no detailed account of the game has hitherto been published. It is played in four parallel rows of holes made in the ground or scooped out of sand, there being an even number of holes in each row. When only two players participate it is not customary to have more than twelve holes in a row, but when there are two or more players on each side, as is frequently the case, there may be twenty-four or more holes in a row. The players squat or kneel on opposite sides of the board facing one another. At the beginning of a game each player places two pieces—small stones, seeds, or fragments of dried dung—in each of the holes of his outer row, and the same number in each of the holes in the right half of his inner row as shown in Fig. 1, I.\nThe object of the game is to capture all the pieces of one’s adversary or to put him ill a position in which he is no longer able to move any of his pieces. The moves are made alternately. The mode of progression consists in each of the players in turn taking up the contents of any of the holes on his side of the hoard, in which there are two or more pieces, and distributing these one at a time in a counter-clockwise direction in the succeeding holes of the same row. If the last of the pieces thus taken up and distributed by one of the players is dropped into an empty hole, his move comes to an end and his opponent plays. If, on the other hand, it is dropped into an occupied hole, one of two things happens:\n(a) If the hole in question is in his inner row and has opposite it in the inner row of his opponent an occupied hole he is entitled to capture ( ||am) the pieces in this hole, together with those in the corresponding hole of his opponent’s outer row; the “men” thus captured being distributed one at a time in the succeeding holes of his inner row.t Thus in Fig. 1, III 1, for example, the player Q has just finished a move by dropping a “last man” in hole c—7. As this hole was occupied—it now contains three( pieces—\nand the hole b—7 in P’s inner row is also occupied, he is entitled to capture the single piece in b—7 and the two pieces in a—7. He does so, the appropriation being represented by a black rectangle, and drops the captured pieces one at a time into c—6, c—.5 and c—4 (Fig. 1, III 2) where his move comes to an end. (b) If the hole in his opponent’s inner row, opposite to the one in which his last piece was dropped, is not occupied; or if the last of the pieces he took up is dropped into one of the holes in his outer row contain ing one or more pieces, he has to continue his move by taking up all the pieces in the hole in question, including the one that he dropped, and distributing them as before. A number of instances of this occur in the game described on the following pages.\nUnder no circumstances may a move be inaugurated from a hole containing a single piece. When, therefore, a player has only one piece in each of his occupied holes, he can no longer move and loses the game. ||Hus differs in this respect from all the games to lie subsequently dealt with."

It is to have four lines in the shape of an “x” that goes from the second [inside corner] square [b2, b7, g2, or g7] and goes to the second [inside corner] square diagonally across. The other line does the same. The one that goes through white squares is to be black and the one that goes through black, white in order to divide between the types of pieces. And these lines that cut through the squares mark the direction in which the pawns are to move first – those to the right move to the right and likewise for those to the left. They capture forward and diagonally as pawns should capture.\nAnd these pieces are thirty-two in total and are to be set up in the four corners of the board. Each arrangement is to have eight pieces that are a king, a rook, a knight, a fil, and four pawns. All pieces are to move wherever they want according to their movements in the other chess that is more common.\nAnd this is their arrangement: the kings are placed in the corner most squares on the board. The rook is next to the king, the knight is on the other, and the fil in front of him. Two pawns face one side of the board and the other two face the other. In this chess there is no fers until one of the pawns is promoted.\nAnd there are four kings and four men each with his pieces of his colour are to play on it.\nAnd the colours are these four that we have said correspond to the seasons. Spring’s pieces are green; summer’s are red; autumn’s black, and winter’s white.\nOn how they are to begin to play with these pieces.\nThe player with the green pieces is to play first and he should move towards his right, towards the other player who has the red pieces. This is like spring moving towards summer. He who has the red pieces should also play towards the other player who has the white pieces at the same time defending himself from green. The one with the black pieces is to play also towards his right, against the player who has the white (The ms. says black in error. Black, whose move is being described, cannot play towards himself. However, it is interesting to note that the two words used for black are different. In the first chapter, the “Libro del acedrex”, the word used for black is always prieto whether describing the black pieces or the black squares on the board. In this fifth chapter of four-player games the word used to refer to the black chess pieces is always negro while the black squares are described with prieto. In four-player tables the word used for black’s pieces is once again prieto. In the seventh and final chapter on astrological games, the word used for Saturn’s black piece is negro in both the chess and the tables.) guarding always from attack from the player with the red pieces. He who has the white pieces should do the same, guarding against attack from black. After [the first move] each player may move according to his will.\nAnd thus in playing these four players take from one another like the seasons of the year which also take from one another.\nAnd each of these four players should make an opening wager. Thereafter for each piece that a player loses he should pay an amount as well as for each check given to a king.\nAnd when a player is checkmated he pays the victor an amount for as many pieces as he has on the board and then removes his pieces. Of the three players that remain thereafter, the first to be defeated leaves on the board as much as he has won and an amount for each of his pieces that remain when he is checkmated. Of the two remaining players, the one who wins takes all the money on the board plus the loser gives him an amount for each of his remaining pieces.\nAnd this is what the board and pieces look like as well as their arrangement, painted here."

The player who is the last in possession of counters wins.', '"This game (Game 10), spoken of in Kunama as andada is based on two long rows each of from twelve to no less than twenty-four holes—a length of row unknown elsewhere in Ethiopia, but almost equalled by the 20-hole rows used in some games of Nigeria—with two balls per hole, and is mainly played by elders. More than two players often play in which case each side would be apportioned equally into two, three, or four portions, one for each player. The game would then become a contest between two groups of players, each of which would consult among itself how best to move, who on any side actually moved the counters being largely a matter as to who was nearest to the balls on the move. The game can be played by agreement either in an anti-clockwise or, less common, in a clockwise direction, the very possibility of clockwise play being itself unusual in the Ethiopian region. Play begins with an opening gambit whereby a player starting anywhere on his row would pick up two counters and drop them into the next two holes after which he would take up the next pair of balls and proceed in this way, thereby redistributing all the balls into a 3, 0, 3, 0 patter which would develop exactly provided the number of holes per row was twelve or other multiple of three. On the completion of this gambit the players would decide by agreement who should begin the game proper, this decision being once more unusual among Ethiopian board games in having apparently no relation to the question as to whom effected the pre-play gambit. The first player to move would pick up the entire contents of any of his holes and then drop the counters one by one in the following holes. If the last ball fell on an occupied hole he would, as in most Ethiopian board games, pick up its contents and continue to distribute them one by one, proceeding in this manner until he alighted on an empty hole whereupon he would stop. If this happened in one of his own holes he would take and put aside the contents, if any, of his opponent''s opposite hole, whereupon the move came to an end. The players would thus move alternately, each attempting, especially towards the end of the game, to fill the hole towards the rear of his line of play and to empty the corresponding holes of his opponent. As soon as both sides were reduced to the possession of only single balls the game enteres its final and untypical phase, during which a player reaching the end of his row with any ball would put it with his takings instead of moving across on to his opponent''s side, the player remaining last in possession of one or more counters being the winner of the game."

This version resembled the Saramacca type of adji more than the lontu-holo, since in this each player occupies the holes along the length of the board nearest him,  and each plays his seeds about the entire board. It nis also similar in that it is a game of capture, and the player who, at the end of a game, has more than half the seeds, wins. The same red and black adji-bean that is used by the Saramacca people is also used by the Djukas...However, with the points of resemblance mentioned, similarity to the Saramacca form of the game ends. The game is played with four seeds to a cup, and the player who "breaks tge holes" plays out of any cup on his side of the board, leaving no seeds in the one that has been played, and going in counter-clockwise direction about the board as far as the seeds he has taken in a given move permit. Thus, if player X start with cup "E," then he places one seed each in "D," "C," "B," and "A"; if player Y on the next move "breaks his holes" by playing from "e," he place  one each in "f," "F," "E," and "D." Once a cup has been emptied for play, it must remain empty during the entire move, and this is important, later in the game, when a very full cup is being emptied, for in such a case, should it contain more than 12 seeds, it must be skipped in play. Thus player X, distributing 13 seeds from cup "C" would end in "A" rather than "B." If a player ends his play in an enemy cup containing one or two seeds (making a two or three) he captures these seeds and those in any continuous series of cups holding either two or three seeds, provided that he himself has filled them to the proper number. Capture can only be effected on the enemy''s side of the board, so that to end on one''s own side is not advantageous to a player, except where there are considerations of strategy to be taken into account. The game being of one capture, a player may find himself without any seeds to move.

Sowing occurs in a clockwise direction from the left half of a player''s row, and anti-clockwise when played from the player''s right half of the row, player''s choice when there is a central hole. The first seed of sowing is placed in the hole from which the sowing began. When the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole, and it now contains an even number of counters, these are captured, provided the contents of that hole have already been moved. Should the following hole also contain an even number of counters, these are also captured, as well as the next one, until there is a hole with an odd number of counters. If a player cannot move, they must pass until the opponent plays in such a way that they may play. If neither player is able to move, they both capture the counters in their rows. Players then count their counters by placing them six per hols. The player who has more counters than necessary to fill their holes places them aside for use in successive rounds. The player who is unable to fill a hole with six counters leaves it empty, also placing the extra counters aside for later use. This hole is not to be sown into. The player chooses which hole to leave empty. The player may place captured counters in this hole, and if the opponent sows into it, the player may immediately capture the sown counter. Otherwise, play proceeds as normal. Players alternate being the starting player, and subsequent rounds continue until one player cannot fill a hole with six counters.\n', '"This game, known as béchi...The Kunama game is based on two rows each of four or sometimes three holes with six balls per hole, and is generally played by boys and youths. One of several unusual features of the game is that play is clockwise when a move is begun from one set of holes and anti-clockwise when begun from another. Thus when played with four holes per row each of the two players would move in a clockwise direction when starting a move from one of his two left-hand holes, and in an anti-clockwise direction when starting from one of his two right-hand holes, the result being that at the beginning of any move each player would be advancing in the direction opposite to that followed by his opponent when starting from one or other of the opposite holes. The same principles apply when the game is played on a three-hole board, except that a player starting from his central hole would each time be free to choose in which direction he wished to proceed. Other unusual features of the game consist in the fact that players do not take up the entire contents of any of their holes, but always leave one ball behind, and that on dropping the last counter in his hand into an occupied hole the players move comes to an end without him picking up its contents for further distribution as in the case of most Ethiopian board games...They could thus under no circumstances pick up a single ball. Captures were effected in an unusual manner in so far as a player could capture balls on either row not only on his opponent''s as is more generally the case. A player would effect a capture if he dropped the last ball in his hand into a hole, either on his own side or his opponent''s, provided (a) the contents of that hole had already been moved and (b) the hole in consequence of his move contained an even number of balls...Should the immediately following hole or holes also contain even groups of balls, the player would capture them too, irrespective of the actual number of balls, provided only that it has an even number. On effecting any capture, either from one or more holes, the player''s move ended. A player unable to move for lack of any group of two or more holes on his side would wait until his opponent''s play once again created such a situation in which case he would resume play. When, however, neither player could move the round would come to an end, each player appropriating the counters, if any, remaining on his side. The players would then count out their counters six by six into the holes on their respective sides. A player having captured more balls than were necessary to fill his holes would place such counters aside for possible use in a later round, while a player unable to fill all his holes completely would leave the residue empty, and, if left with one or more extra balls would likewise put them aside for later use. The player thus unable to fill all his holes completely would be free to choose which too leave empty, and could indeed often fill holes on both halves of his row, thus enabling him to move in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction...Players were not allowed to drop counters into a hole which had thus been left empty at the beginning of a round. Any such hole was known by onomatopoeia as shuda ita or hole containing which one said shu, and a player with such a hole or holes on his row might place his takings in one or more of them to confuse his opponent, for if the latter dropped a ball there he forfeited it to the owner of the hole unless he removed it before the latter had the chance to say shu...The players could, however, make a prior agreement not to adopt any such tricks. The players would start each round of the game alternately, and play would continue until one of the players was left with insufficient balls with which to fill a hole; I.e. until he had less than six counters.

It is played with sixteen pieces of the same shape; but every four of them must have the same colour. The pieces all move in the same direction. The players use three dice. Four of the six side of each dice are greater than the remaining two, the four long sides being marked with one, two, five, and six dots respectively. The players draw two sets of two parallel lines, of which one set bisects the other at right angles. These parallel lines are of equal length. The small square which is formed by the intersection of the two sets in the centre of the figure is left as it is; but the four rectangles adjoining the sides of the square are each divided into twenty-four equal spaces in three rows, each of eight equal spaces, as shown in figure (XVII). The game is generally played by four players, of which he puts two against the other two. Each player has four pieces, of which he puts two in the sixth and seventh spaces of the middle row of the parallelogram before him, and the other two in the seventh and eighth spaces of the right row. The left row remains empty. Each player moves his pieces, according to his throw, in the outer row, always keeping to the right, till he arrives at the outer left row of the parallelogram from which he started; and from there he moves to the middle row. When arrived at the latter place, he is puktah (ripe), and from here, he must throw for each of his pieces the exact number which will carry them to the empty square in the centre of the figure. he is now rasidah, or arrived. When a player is puktah or rasidah, he may commence to play from the beginning, which leads to amusing combinations. As long as a player keeps two of his pieces together, the adversary cannot throw them out. If a player throws a double six, he can move two pieces over twelve spaces, provided the two pieces stand together on one field; but he is allowed to move them only six fields onwards, should he prefer doing so. A similar rule holds for double fives, &c. A throw consisting of six, a five, and a one, is called khim (raw); and in this case, two pieces, provided they are together on the same field, may each be moved six fields forwards, and every single piece twelve fields,.

The pieces move in the squares instead of going along the lines. It requires two players, who have a rectangular board of 144 squares, twelve beign on each side, alternately coloured red (or black) and white. Each player has thirty pieces called Itta (pl.Itto), which are placed on the white squares at each end of the board, as in Draughts, that is, in six out of each row of twelve squares, thus leaving only the two central rows vacant. The Itto move only diagonally, and capture or "chop" the opposing pieces by jumping over them, and taking several consecutively if possible. They can move backwards as well as forwards from the beginning, thus having the powers of Kings in the ordinary English game. Excepting when capturing the opposing Itto, the ordinary pieces move to the distance of only one square at a time. Every Itta which succeeds in reaching the last square on the opponent''s side of the board is doubled, and is termed a "King." With this increase in rank it acquires additional powers, and it may proceed to the end of each diagonal at one move, if the end square be empty and the way be open, or to any intermediate square, as in Polish Draughts, jumping over and capturing any opponent''s pieces on the way if there be any in suitable positions on that diagonal. If cannot pass over Itto or Kings of its own side, and only over opposing ones if the next square to them be empty. If any of the opponent''s pieces be captured on this diagonal and the king can enter the end square, it may continue its course in the same manner, as part of the same move, to the end or to an intermediate square of the second diagonal, at a right angle from the last one, and so on over a third or more. To be permitted to do this, however, it must capture one or more pieces on each diagonal passed over, and there must always be an empty square for it to enter in the diagonal. If the King take no pieces whether Itto or Kings, on the first diagonal, he cannot proceed further than its end at one move. He has the option of remaining at any empty intermediate square before reaching the end of a diagonal. All pieces must jump over every opposing piece which they capture; they cannot stop in its square, or jump over it unless the next square be empty.

Play is based on two double rows of holes joined by a single row of two holes in the middle, with five, three, and four balls in each hole in the following pattern. Each player, as in other games, owned one of the tow main rows, but the two central holes, unless captured in the method described below belonged to neither player. Play is fairly similar to leya gobale in as far as the opening moves are concerned. Each player would thus start somewhere on his own row by picking up the entire contents of that hole, never of course from one of the central holes which were neutral, and moving in an anti-clockwise direction, would distribute the balls in his hand into ensuing holes, picking up the contents of the hole in which his last counter dropped, unless this happened to be one of the central holes in which case his move would come to an end. On stopping in an empty hole on his own side the player would capture the contents, if any, of his opponent''s opposite hole, putting it, as well as his own last counter, aside as his takings, unless the opposite hole held three balls, in which case they would be called leyla gobale and belong to the player who would then re-arrange them into two pairs of two. Having done this the player would automatically become the owner of one of the central holes, and would choose the one with the largest number of holes as his capture. Neither player could pick up balls from either leyla gobale or the central holes which would thus increase in balls as the play proceeded. Should one or both of the central holes remain uncaptured at the end of a round of play, i.e. when one of the players was no longer able to play because he was left without counters on his side, the contents of that hole or holes would be left there, thus constituting a prize for possible capture in the following round. The count down, as in leyla gobale, would be effected by the weaker player arranging his balls in his holes, in this case as far as possible in the same numerical arrangement as at the beginning of the first round or in roughly the same proportion. The stronger player would the put back exactly the same number of balls in his opposite holes. Should the weaker player be left with insufficient balls to fill all his holes, he would start filling such holes from his left, one counter to each hole, the holes to his right being accordingly closed down."

When the final counter lands into an empty hole in the row belonging to the player, the counters in the opposite hole belonging to the opponent are captured, and the counter that triggered the capture is moved to the following hole. This could trigger the further capture of more of the opponent''s counters if the hole in which the counter is placed was empty and the opponent''s opposite hole contains counters. If the hole is occupied, sowing continues. If the hole is empty and the opposite hole is unoccupied or it is one of the opponent''s holes, sowing ends. When one player can no longer play because the holes on their side are empty, the opponent captures the remaining counters on the board. A new round begins. The losing player places three counters in each hole, beginning on the rightmost hole. If the player has remaining counters but cannot fill their holes with three, they must distribute the remainder to fill as many of the remaining holes as possible with at least one counter. The winning player from the previous round then matches this starting configuration, keeping any surplus for use in future rounds. Play continues until one player has one or zero counters, the opponent being the winner.', '"This game based on two rows each of sic holes, with three balls per hole was reported by three Ansaba students of the Teachers'' Training Institute at Asmara, Andom Takla Maryam, Isaq Habté and Yohannes Imar. This game, though played on two rows, follows the distinctive principles of Game 1. The two players, each starting from his extreme right hand hole this begin to play simultaneously, racing each other to be the first to reach an empty hole, the first to do so being the first to move in the ensuing stage of the game during which players move alternately. Captures, again as in Game 1, are effected whenever a player alights in one of his empty holes whereupon he captures the contents of his opponent''s opposite hole, the piece effecting this capture being then moved on as part of the same move, and before the other player has a chance to play...When, in fact, at the end of the round, a player is left without counters in any of his holes the remaining counters, I.e. those on the opposite row, are appropriated by the owner of that row, a practice common in fact in most types of gabata. This game is, however, unusual in its procedure for starting the next or any subsequent round. The weaker player, I.e. the one with less counters, will start to refill his holes from the right. He will as far as he can place three balls in each hole, but being unable to do so in all, may place only two counters immediately to the left of his group or groups of three, and will if at all possible put single balls in one or more of the holes on the left, the objective being to have counters, if this can be done, in every hole. The more successful player will then refill his holes with an identical number of balls as his opponent, and will arrange them in the same manner, thus keeping aside the surplus balls in his possession for future use if needed, play continuing in this manner, round after round, until one of the players succeeds in monopolising at least all but one of the balls whereupon his opponent, unable to reoccupy a hole at the end of the round would be defeated."

The game was reported by Isaac Gabra Maryam, a student of the Addis Ababa Commercial School, who say it played by a [n Oromo] woman of the Bolé area of Addis Ababa. The first player begins on his extreme left by picking up the four balls in that hole which, always moving in an anti-clockwise direction, he places in the following hole. He then moves the contents of the next hole to the one following it, and proceeds in this way round the board, thereby arranging the balls in a 0, 8, 0, 8 pattern, but, dropping the last group of four balls (on his opponent''s right hole) he picks up all eight balls and distributes them one by one, picking up the contents of the hole in which he drops his last ball and then sowing these balls one by one as in the games above referred to. Captures are effected by a player whenever a group of four balls forms in any of his holes, but on dropping the last ball in his hand he does not make any capture, as in some lam waladach games, but has merely to continue distributing the balls."

The special feature of this game which, as we shall see, is today perhaps the most widely diffused throughout the central provinces of Ethiopia, lies in the opening gambit whereby the first player to move would pick up and hold in his palm one of the balls in his extreme right hole, then, moving always in an anti-clockwise direction, he would pick up one ball from his opponent''s opposite hole and place it in the next hole, and would proceed in this manner round the board, rearranging the counters in a 3, 5, 3, 5 pattern, until on reaching his opponent''s right hand hole he would drop into it the ball in his hand, thereby increasing the contents of that hole from three to four balls.

Thus instead of picking up the entire contents of any of his holes he takes only one counter, preferably from the hole on his extreme right. Then...he places this ball in his palm, and, moving in an anti-clockwise direction, he takes up a ball from his opponent''s immediately opposing hole, and places it in the adjacent hole, continuing in this way-so that the contents of each hole alternate between three and five balls-until he reaches the last of his opponent''s holes into which he places the counter he had originally palmed, thereby making a weg by increasing its contents from three to four balls. The first player in this game thus automatically captures a weg in his first round, doing so moreover in the location which, as we have seen, was the best possible one for such a capture.

The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left).Each player has fifteen pieces, which all beginning on the first point of their track. Two dice are used. Players move according to the points on each particular die; they may move one piece according to the sum of the dice, or two separate pieces each using the value on one die. The maximum number of pieces per point is two, except for the starting point. Placing pieces on the twelfth point of a player''s side is only allowed when it can be achieved by two pieces on the same dice roll. A player''s pieces only actually move on the player''s half of the board; points are awarded for any hypothetical move that would move a player''s pieces along the imagined track onto the opponent''s side of the board that would land on a point with a lone opposing piece (a "hit"). The player then moves pieces on their side of the board that are able to move. If the hypothetical hit is in the opponents'' nearest half of the board according to the track, the player scores two points, four points if it was achieved by rolling doubles. If the hit is in the further half of the opponent''s side of the board, the player scores four or six if made by doubles. There are other ways of scoring points. If a player can place a piece on each of the first six points after the starting point after their first three rows, they score four points. The player is nor required to move the pieces to this position on the third throw. If a roll brings two pieces to the sixth and seventh points before the opponent takes their twelfth point, and these are the only two pieces which have moved from the starting point, the player scores four points, or six points if the roll was doubles. In this same scenario there the opponent has moved two pieces to the twelfth point, the opponent is awarded these points. If the player has moved only two pieces from the starting position, both are on the twelfth point, the opponent has not moved their pieces to their twelfth point, and the player rolls a one, they score four points, six points if double ones are rolled. If this occurs and the opponent has occupied their twelfth points, the opponent scores the points. Players play until one scores twelve points. The winner may choose to return to the starting position or continue to play in the same configuration. However, if the winning score is achieved by the opponent''s throw, the game continues in the current position. When a player chooses to continue in the current position, they may keep any points in excess of the twelve required to win, but the opponent loses any accumulated points. The first player to win twelve games wins.

Players then move alternately. If they play with the first array, the first three turns are made by sowing from the holes with three holes, proceeding in order from the one furthest to the left, sowing two in the nest hole and one in the following. They then sow from the next hole to the right with three counters on the next turn in the same way. If they play with the second array, the take turns sowing from each of the holes with four  counters, beginning with the rightmost hole, placing two in the first hole and one in each of the following. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player''s side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in ''opposition'' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent''s holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent''s counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses.

The rules for ''eating'' are quite different from those in ''ayoyayo,'' but apart from this the moves are as follows. When one hand is empty the player continues to move round the board from the point where he left off using the seeds in the other hand. On the last of his seeds being dropped, he takes up all the seeds now in the house in which this seed has fallen and continues to move round the board using his fresh supply of seeds. The gambit is continued as long as his last seed does not drop into an empty house. Totals of four made during this play are removed from the board and the player continues his circuit of the board unless the last seed in hand makes the number of seeds in the house reached up to four, in which case he removes them, but has nothing with which to continue his move. In "J''erin" a player cannot take seeds from his opponent''s houses, as in ayoyayo, but only from his own side of the board, and if he omits to take any set of seeds to which, by the above rule, he is entitled, his opponent may take them. After the game the seeds are replaced in the houses, and in the event of a win (a draw is possible), the winner fills not only his own houses but also some of his opponent''s.

This game based on two rows each of six holes, with four balls per hole, is different...This Wallo game was played by Ibrahim Yusuf, a Baeda Maryam School student from Kombolcha who says it is known as jimafesosh. The game opens with a distinctive gambit, whereby the first player picks up the contents of his extreme right-hand hole and moves it to his opponent''s opposite hole. Moving always in an anti-clockwise direction he moves the contents of his opponent''s next hole into the following hole, and proceeds in this manner to redistribute all the balls in an 8, 0, 8, 0 pattern. On dropping the last group of four balls he picks up all eight balls from that hole and then drops them one by one into the following holes, and continues picking up and dropping in the usual manner until he drops his last ball in an empty hole. Captures are effected whenever a player drops the last ball in an empty hole, whereupon he takes the contents, if any, of the opposite row irrespectively as to the side on which this occurs. The ball effecting the capture is not itself taken and the move thereupon ends, it being the next player''s turn to move. A characteristic aspect of the game occurs towards the end of a round, for when a player is unable to move for lack of counters, the game does not come to an end, as in some games, but he waits while his opponent plays, the counterless player resuming play whenever he finds himself with counters in any of his holes. Only when one ball is left does the game come to an end, with that ball being appropriated by the owner of the hole in which it is situated. At the end of the round the stronger player will capture holes from the weaker as for example in Game 20. If each player is left with two odd balls...his opponent then has to guess under which finger the grass is concealed, thus having a one in four or five chance of success."

A course or track is drawn on the ground or on a board. Two players compete, each with four pieces called moskúkua. The players start at two opposing points called apórun. The course followed by one player is indicated in the figure. Each piece is advanced in accordance with the score made by throwing four stick dice. The players take turns throwing the dice and moving the pieces. A player may apply the score made in one throw to only one piece. If a piece comes to rest on the points marked B, it is said to be burned and must be started again at A, but until it is put in play again it must rest at point C, kurínckua or bonfire. While on the interior part of the course the pieces of the two players will never stop on the same spot, but on the outer part of the route this may happen. In this case the second arrival "kills" the first, which then must begin again at A. Until put in play again a "killed" piece must stay in circles D or E according to the player to whom it belongs,. Points F are called Anájcikun or summit. Once a piece makes the circuit of a loop at the corner of the board, it does not touch point G a second time, but goes instead to point H, unandándani. In this way there is no possibility of confusion as to whether a piece is entering or leaving the loop. To complete the course each piece enters the interior track a second time. If the piece safely reaches any spot past point B it is regarded as having finished the circuit. The player who first gets all four of this pieces past B wins the game. The dice are called kolicatarakua. Theya re half round on the side, flat on the other and are about a palm breadth in length. Usually two sticks are split in half to make the four dice.

When a player alighted with the last ball in his hand on one of his empty holes facing an enemy hole containing two counters he captured those counters, as well as any other groups of two balls on his opponent''s row. 4. Play came to an end when one of the players could no longer move because he had no more counters on his side. his opponent would thereupon appropriate such balls as remained in his own row and add them to his winnings. The players would then count out their takings by placing them back, two by two, into the gabata board.

To begin, he places a large stone in any of the holes on his side, and five small stones in each of the other holes. Terminology: The laomuzhu (old sow) is a large stone, which gives the game its name. While playing, the large stone is called laogu, an informal term...The zhuer (piglet) is a small stone. Play: Standard pussa kanawa relays and captures. Laogu: The laogu are sown, relayed and captured normally. Each laogu retains its identity and belongs to the player who possessed it  at the beginning of the round. But when a laogu is sown into a hole containing zhuer, it captures them for its owner, whatever the hole. That is, it is the identity of the large stone, not the location of the hole, which determines who captures the stones. Just as in yucebao, the laogu is necessarily singleton. If a laogu is sown into a hole containing another laogu, the former captures the latter, no matter who is moving. Rounds: A player fills as many holes as he can on his own side, with five zhuer, or with one laogu. Holes which cannot be filled are let empty at the start of the round, but belong to no one, are sown into and captured from, and as soon as they are non-empty, may be played from by either player.

The former described the game as played in a clockwise direction on two rows of six holes...Both authorities agree, however, that there are four balls per hole. The first player would begin by picking up all the balls from any of his holes and would drop them singly in ensuing holes, picking up the contents of the hole in which his last ball fell, and proceeding in this manner until he reached an empty hole when he would stop, it being then the second player''s turn to move. A player dropping the last ball in his hand into one of his opponent''s holes containing three balls would effect a capture, not only of that hole but of his own opposite hole, both holes being referred to as wegi. The player to indicate the status of these holes would probably make a mark next to them in the sand, and would equalise their contents by transferring balls from one hole to the other, and, according to Ba''alul, would continue to do this as needed from time to time during the play. Neither player was entitled to pick up balls from wegi as from other holes, though a player dropping the last ball in his hand into either of his opponent''s pair of wegi captured one counter and put it aside, together with the ball effecting the capture, as his winnings. Such a capture would conclude his move, the player not being entitled, to continue it as in Central Ethiopia, for example. The round would come to an end when one of the players could no longer move, at which time his opponent would appropriate the balls remaining on his own side as his takings. At the end of the round the players would count down the balls they had captured. Ba''alul says they would do this by refilling their holes, the more successful player filling only as many as his opponent could fill, and holding over his surplus for a future round if needed, the remaining holes being covered in with sand. A player, generally the one with the larger number of counters, who had two balls beyond those necessary to fuill his hole or holes would lend them to his opponent, such a loan to be repaid in a later round.

If a player has no counters in their holes, the opponent must give them one counter, to be placed in the leftmost hole and played from there. Play ends when the board is cleared of counters. Each player counts the number of counters they captured. The player with more counters is given a score equal to the difference in the number of counters. Another round begins again exactly as before. The game is won when a player accumulates sixty points.\n', '"Others generally play ion a different manner,which is termed "the game of the wise, or intelligent" ("leab el-''akil"), and which now must be described. The hasa are distributed in one or more beyts on one side, and in the corresponding beyt or beyts on the other side; commonly in four beyts on each side, leaving the two extreme beyts of each side vacant: or they are distributed in any other conventional manner; as, for instance, about half into beyt A and the remainder in beyt a. The person who distributes the hasa does not count how may he places in a beyt; and it is at his option whether he places them only in one beyt on each sixe, or in all the beyts. Should the other person object to his distribution, he may turn the board round; but in that case he forfeits his right of playing first. The person who plays first may begin from any one of his beyts; judging by his eye which will bring him the best fortune. He proceeds in the same manner as before described; putting one hasweh in each beyt; and taking in the same cases as in the former mode; and then the other plays. After the first gain, he counts the hasa in each of his beytsl and plays from that which will bring him the greatest advantage...The gain of one party after finishing one board is counted, as in the former mode, by the excess of the number he has take above the number acquireed by the other; and the first who makes his successive gains to amount to sixty wins the game...it is commonly played at the coffeeshops."

Three casting sticks, each with a round and a flat side, are used as dice. The throws are as follows: One flat side up = 1; two flat sides up = 2; three flat sides up = 4, zero flat sides up = 6. The pieces begin on the outer end of the track, and must throw a 1 to begin play. Once a player has left the starting spot, they move according to the throws, except on throws of 1, which are tabulated for use later. Players continue to throw until they throw 2. Players must land on the last space of the track, I.e. at the center of the spiral, by an exact throw, and may use one of their accumulated throws of 1 if a 1 is required. The player must then roll 1 five times before leaving this space and proceeding back to the starting point. Accumulated rolls of 1 may be used for this. If the player must wait, they may accumulate individual throws of 2, 4, or 6 to use later. The first player to reach the starting space by an exact throw releases the hyena, which cannot move until 1 is thrown twice, or paid from the accumulated throws. The hyena proceeds along the track in the same manner, but moving twice the value of each throw. When the hyena reaches the end of the track, it must throw or pay 1 ten times. The hyena captures any piece it overtakes on the return to the starting space, eliminating that player from the game.', '" Li''b El Merafib, or the Hyaena Game (Kababish) The hyaena game is both more ingenious and more amusing than any race game played with dice by English children which I have seen. The dice consist of three pieces of split stick, each about six inches long, on which the bark has been left, so that each stick has one rounded green surface and on flat white one. The three sticks are thrown up and may fall:— Two green and one which, which is called a tâba, Two white and one gree, which is called yômên, Three white, which is called rabî'', Three green, which is called séta. The board is made by scooping a spiral groove in the sane and making a random number of hollows along its course. The bigger the spiral, of course, the longer the game will last. Fig. 11 shows a board set for four players. The middle hollow X is the well. the hollow Y at the other end of the spiral, is the village. The sticks 1, 2, 3, 4 represent the mothers of the players. The following are the rules of play :— 1. The players throw the dice in turn, each player throwing time after time, during his turn, until he is brought  to  standstill by a throw of yômên, when he hands the dice to the next player. 2. A player has to throw a tâba to enable his mother to leave the village at all, just as in race games played by English children one must throw a six to start. 3. After she has left the village, a tâba having been thrown by her son, she moves two "days" (I.e. hollows) for a throw of yômín, four "days" for a rabî'' and six for a séta. She does not move for a tâba, which is, however, marked down on the sand to the credit of the player, for a use which will appear presently. 4. a mother must reach the well exactly. Thus if she is an odd number of "days" away from it she will arrive one day short of it, and may then use one of her son''s credit of tâbas to complete the journey. 5. At the well, she required two tâbas to  drink, one to wash her clothes and two to come away with. If a player has not this number of tâbas to his credit, his mother has to wait until he has scored them. If she has to wait there, however, the player is allowed to mark down for later use any other scores of two, four, or six, which he may throw in the meantime. 6. On coming down from the well, the women make their way back, in the same manner, to the village, from which the first to arrive lets loose the hyaena. 7. The hyaena (represented by the player whose mother first arrived at the village) is enabled to leave it on payment of two tâbas, after which he moves towards the well at double rates, I.e. four " days" for a yômên, eight for a rabî'', twelve for a séta. 8. Arrived at the well he is held up, for it costs him ten tâbas to drink and come away again. 9. on leaving the well he still moves at double rates and eats any woman whom he overtakes. He cannot eat before drinking. In this game, the hyaena may be said to be the winner, but there are degrees of defeat. The player whose mother gets eaten by the hyaena is rudely mocked by the one who manages to get the old lady safely back to the village." Davies 1925: 145-146.', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, NULL),

Pawns reaching any other square must make two moves along the before they can be promoted; the first must be a lateral move, the second may be lateral or diagonal. .Player wins when they capture the other player''s king.', '"I HAVE been engaged in watching some of the head men amusing them selves at Chess, which is a favorite game with them. They are really skilful in playing it after their own fashion. . It is called main chatur, or game of chequers. The King is the rajah ; the Queen mautri, or minister; the Bishop, gajah, or elephant; the Knight, kudah, or horseman; the Castle, tor, or chariot; and the Pawn, bidah, or foot-soldier. The check is ex pressed by asah, and checkmate, by mati. So far it resembles the nomenclature of other Malay countries. Crawford informs us that the Javanese are hardly acquainted with the game, save by report, which certainly §. far to shew that it was not introduced by the Hindoos ; whilst the alays are passionately attached to it, having in more recent times acquired it from the Telingas, who, from the evidence of language, must have taken it from the Persians, the names being in that language. For instance, “chatur,” the name of the game, is Persian, and not Indian ; “sah,” check, is the Persian word “shah,” and the only way in which the Indian Islanders can pronounce it; “bidah,” a Pawn, is but a corruption of “piadah,” a foot-soldier; and “mat,” is the true Persian word for checkmate, borrowed by ourselves, and more correctly by the French. These are Crawford''s reasons, and very substantial ones, not only to prove that Chess was not introduced by the Hindoos into the Archipelago, but that they have no title to the invention of that noble game; and, as he adds, “Sir William Jones acknowledges that no account of such a game exists in the writings of the Brahmans.” I can see little to oppose to this reasoning; and I think it may be pronounced that Chess, having been invented in Persia, travelled thence to India, and, subsequently, from the Telinga country to the Archipelago. I am unacquainted with the game as played by the Persians; but, as neither Marsden nor Crawford describes the Malay method, which differs considerably from that of Europe, I shall here insert it. The board is placed in the same way, and the Queens stand to the right of their respective Kings, which brings each Queen opposite to her adverse King. This is the only difference in placing the pieces. The moves are precisely similar to our own, with the exception of the King''s. The King, when checked for the first time, has the right of making the Knight''s move, or to move two squares. After this sally, he is reduced to the same powers as a European King. This first move (in which he can of course take), on being checked, alters the game considerably, as one great object then becomes to prevent the check of your own King early in the game, and to gain a check of your adversary. The usual, and apparently the most approved, method amongst them, is to open the game from the Queen''s Castles Pawn, and, pushing out the Queen''s Knight''s and the Queen''s Bishop''s Pawns, to manoeuvre the Queen behind them. It appears to me that all this greatly cramps the game, in some measure, renders it more tricky, and prevents the real strength of the various pieces from being fully developed, in order to guard against a check; for it will be evident, if the King be once checked, he is deprived of one great advantage which your adversary still holds, Castling is not allowed except in two moves, the first being the Castle''s move up to the King, and on the King receiving a check, he can exercise his right of jumping to the inside of the Castle. The remaining difference in the game is the play of the Pawns: a Pawn, moved out, cannot pass an adversary''s Pawn, his first move being restricted to one square in this case; and a Pawn having been pushed up into the adversary''s game, he cannot call a piece except on the Castle''s square, and the Pawn, arriving at the other squares, being obliged, before he gains a Queen or piece, to make two extra moves; for instance, should a Pawn have arrived at the Queen''s Bishop''s square, he may gain a Queen or other piece by moving to the Knight''s square; and lastly, to the Castle''s first square, or, at his option, to the Knight''s first square, and then, optional, either to the Bishop''s second or the Castle''s second, or else to the Queen or King''s first, or Queen''s first and King''s second. In fact, this is a delay rather than a prevention, as, from the number of squares which may be taken, it is extremely difficult to guard them all.

His first move is either one square forward or diagonally, but at any period of the game he may take the adversary''s piece on the square before him, but not that one which may stand in his rear.

If a king is left alone to contend, his aim is to get so placed as to prevent being check mated within a certain number of moves.

Thus, if the king has opposed to him a king and two castles—the number of pieces on the board four—is deducted from the prescribed number eight.

They then take a counter from the next hole after that, and placing it in the next hole, continuing until there is an alternating pattern of a hole with five counters followed by a hole with three counters. The original hole from which the first counter was taken will have four counters. The player will then place the first counter taken into the next hole in the opponent''s row, causing it to hold four counters.

The game is again based on two rows of six holes, with four balls per hole, and is broadly similar to qelat II, but has the following special features: 1, The decision who should play first is often taken by a process of "racing" identical to that employed in the three-row game of the highlands of Eritrea and this seems to reflect some measure of cultural identity between the two areas. In the game under discussion the players may, however, agree as to who should move first in which case there is no need to resort to "racing." 2. After the capture of a mewegae, which was effected, as described in the previous game, by dropping the last ball of a player''s hand into one of his opponent''s holes containing three counters, the procedure is significantly different. Whenever such a hole is captured the opponent of its capturer cannot tax or "eat" from it until he has first dropped one last ball in that hole. On doing this he would say teseta, literally "let her drink" and would thereafter be free to tax from that hole in the normal way by dropping there the last ball of his hand. 3.

Played once more on a two-row board with six holes  per row and four balls per hole...The Western Ertirean variant is, howeverm apparently unique in that it often begins, like mewegae, with "racing" which is unknown to the lam waladach games found further south. After this initial gambit, which is, however, optional, the first player would begin by picking up the entire contents of any of the holes in his row, and then, always proceeding in an anti-clockwise direction, would drop the balls in his hand one by one into the ensuing holes, his own or his opponent''s, lifting up the contents of the hole on which his last ball fell and stopping on ending his hand on an empty hole, whereupon it was the second player''s turn to move. Captures, as in the other lam waladach games, were thereafter effected whenever a group of four balls were formed in any hole. Such groups of four balls would belong to the owner of the row, unless created by the dropping of the last ball in any hand, in which case they became the property of the player who thus made the group, irrespectively of on whose row this happened. Such an act terminated the player''s move, after which it was the opponent''s turn to play. both types of capture has to be effected fairly immediately after the creation of the group or groups of four; if this was not done, and subsequent play resulted in the increase of a group of balls from four to five balls, special penalty procedure, not foiund in other parts of Ethiopia, became operative. Whenever such holes containing five holes, known in Tigrinya as jen, were formed, the previous right to appropriate their contents was forfeited. In such circumstances either player alighting with the last ball in his hand on such a hole, irrespective of whose row it belonged to, effected a capture by taking a ball from that hole and would then put it aside, with the ball making the capture, as his takings. This act of capture, which is clearly reminiscent of that practiced in mewegae, was referred to as mejemetat. Should such a hole become empty the players'' takings were limited to the ball ending there, but the system of putting aside two balls would be resumed whenever the hole filled again. The round would come to an end as soon as a player was no longer able to move for lack of any counters in his holes, at which time his opponent would appropriate the remaining balls on his side as his takings.

Opening play: Opening play: Two players play simultaneously, lifting and sowing counters from their outer rows. Rules for sowing and capturing are the same as in the main phase of the game. Sowing cannot begin from the fourth or fifth hole from the left in the player''s outer hole. Players play until both drop the final counter in an empty hole, the first to do so plays first in the main phase. Players then move alternately. If they play with the first array, the first three turns are made by sowing from the holes with three holes, proceeding in order from the one furthest to the left, sowing two in the nest hole and one in the following. They then sow from the next hole to the right with three counters on the next turn in the same way. If they play with the second array, the take turns sowing from each of the holes with four counters, beginning with the rightmost hole, placing two in the first hole and one in each of the following. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player''s side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in ''opposition'' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent''s holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues.

Começa-se por se distribuir as casas em número igual por cada jogador, ocupando estes zonas seguidas e contíguas em redor do contorno, e fixa-se o número de pedras. Algumas combinaações não são praticáveis por não permiterem que um jogador chegue a comer as pedras do adver sário, como, por exemplo, 2 jogadores, 18 casas e 1 pedra por casa. A paartida é iniciada por um dos participantes, que toma todas as pedras da sua primeira casa, a contar no sentido directo, e as distribui, como é regra nos jogos do tipo mancala, uma a uma, pelas casas que se seguem; o outro ou outros jogadroes, casda um por sua vez e pela sua ordem de posição, repetem esta jogada. Começam a aparecer casas livres à retaguarda de cada jogador, que vão deixando de lhes pertencer à medida quee as desocupam; estas casas passam, seguidamente, a ser de novo ocupadas pelos parceiros que os antecedem, à medida que vão perseguindo-se uns aos outros, ao longo do circuito de casas, mudando a posse destas à medida que o jogo decorre, no sentido directo em que se deslocam as pedras. Quando uma pedra dum jogador vai cair numa casa ocupada por outro parceiro, este perde a ocupação da casa  e a pedra ou pedras nela contidas em beneficio daquele, pedras estas que, no entanto, continuam em jogo. O jogo terminará quando um dos parceiros ocupar todas as casas dos adversários. Dirá então guamutapa (matei).

O Mwendo pratica-se em dois dispositivos diferentes: Conforme o sistema ensinado pelo velho e descrito na lenda de origem do Muvalaval, com a disposição de pedras então indicada; ou Utilizando as casas da periferia de qualquer das quadrículas utilizadas no Muvalavala, com três pedras por casa. As casas existentes são dividadas pelos jogadores, que podem ser mais de dois, e os lanços são sempre iniciados pela primeira casa de cada parceiro. Nos dois casos, a distribuiçao das pedras é sempre feita no sentido inverso, como também foi ensinado pelo velho, segunda a lenda, à razão de uma pedra por cada casa ocupada e de duas por cada casa vazia. Se a última pedra da distribuição de uma mão cair numa casa vazia, diz-se mwendo (continua) e o jogador executa novo lanço, distribuindo as pedras da sua primeira casa da sua nova posição, que é, como se disse, a última que está ocupada, contando-se no sentido contrário ao da distribuição da mão. Este novo lanço é feito da mesma forma que o anterior. Nos sucessivos lanços vai-se entrando no campo do adversário, ocupando-se as casas onde se distribuem as pedras. Neste caso, ao terminar o lanço, o jogador faz um risco à frente da última casa que ocupou para mostrar ao adversário o campo que lhe passa a pertencer, dizendo simultaneamente gunakuli (cortar). É tambem permitido um lanço de jogo em que, em vez  de se distribuírem as pedras uma a uma pelas casas que se seguem, se deslocam em bloco as pedras da primeira para a segunda casa, jogada a que chamam kulumbakana (juntar), o que é contrário à regra geral dos jogos mancala e difere do Quendo. Esta jogada não pode ser feita a seguir a um mwendo porque, nesse caso, a última casa ficaria só com uma pedra, o que não e permitido. Notar que, devido à jogada kulumbakana, o desfecho da partida já depende da argúcia e habilidade dos jogadores. O jogo termina quando um dos jogadores, ao distribuir as suas pedras, ocupa todas as casas do adversário. Neste caso, pode deixar todas as pedras que lhe sobram na mão na última casa que ocupa. No caso de só lha sobrar uma pedra, não ganha o jogo e tem de depositar essa pedra  na casa imediata à última que ocupou do adversário, sem poder fazer mwendo. Este apropria-se dessa pedra isolada e com ela salta todas as casas vazias que tiver à sua frente, a vai ocupar a primeria casa do adversário, dizendo gunatuki (saltei). Um jogador ganha também quando, sem ocupar todo o campo adversário, este só fica com uma casa com duas pedras. Neste caso, logo que o jogador dix gunakuli (cortei) acrescenta sakatanda (já não tenho parceiro).

Then, Wuzurgmihr described (29) the arrangement of the nēw-ardaxšīr upon the board, which was like that established by Ohrmazd, in the gētīg existence, while (30) the revolving and turning of the counters (in opposite directions?) according to the die was similar to the peoples, living in the gētīg, who are tied by a bond to the mēnōg and all of them turn and move according to the seven planets and the twelve zodiacal signs... When the counters hit and remove (the opponent’s ones by stacking up) one on the other, it happens just as the people in the gētīg hit one another; and when by one turning of the die the players continuously remove (the opponent’s counters), it will be just as the people who all pass out of the gētīg; when they set the counters up again, it will be in the likeness of the people who will all come again alive at the resurrection of the dead (31)."

This game is player on a peculiar bent diagram, only one compartment in width, which is cut on a board. The illustration shows its shape. The name may be derived from one of the numbers thrown by the shells, or from the five houses of safety on it in which the counters cannot be attacked...the main part of the diagram rises vertically from a horizontal base. At the point of junction there is a square marked by diagonals and termed a House (Ge); four others occur at bends in the diagram.  In any of these squares the counters are safe from attack. Each of the other plain squares is a Room (Kamara) or Kattiya. The terminal square is known as Kenda-ge. The stations for counters not in play are marked by circles. The game may be played by two, four, six, or eight players, but there are only two opposing sides, half the players being on each side. Six counters termed Itta, pl. itto, are used, three for each side, whatever the number of players may be...Six yellow cowries, usually filled with lead, are used as dice...The counting is as follows:—When all the mouths are upward it counts 6; if five be upwar it counts 5, and is called Pancha; two, three, or four mouths count 2, 3, or 4, respectively; one mouth upward counts 1, called Onduwa; and when no mouths are upward it counts 0, and is called Bokka. For the other numbers the ordinary Sinhalese words are used. To admit each Itta into the board a player must throw 6, 5, or 1. After each of these numbers has been thrown the player has an additional throw, which is repeated as long as he continues to throw any one of them. The counter or Itta then moves up the line of squares to the full extent of the total throws; or the score of each throw may be used for each Itta of that player; it cannot be subdivided.

Sowing occurs in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction; the first player chooses the direction and all subsequent moves are made in that direction. Players sow beginning from holes in their row. In the course of sowing, a player cannot sow into a hole containing three counters; if one is encountered, it is skipped and the counter is sowed into the next hole without three. If the final counter falls into a hole containing three counters, the contents of the hole are captured and the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. Otherwise, if the last counter falls into a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues, or if it falls into an empty hole the turn ends. The round ends when one player''s holes are empty. Second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser, starting from one end of the row, places four counters into as many holes as possible, leaving any extra in the store. The holes which cannot be filled are excluded from play for the round. A twig or piece of straw are often placed over it to indicate this. The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round. Rounds three and above: The winner of round two places four counters in as many of their holes as possible, and the remaining counters in the next hole. If it contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes one counter from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes three. The removed counters go into their store. puta and naga holes are marked with a piece of paper or straw in them. Empty holes are excluded as before. The player with excluded holes begins play in the direction of the excluded hole. Counters cannot be captured or sowed from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before. When one player has fewer than twelve counters, they may arrange them differently at the beginning of a round. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters. Throughout the game, singletons cannot be moved is a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a singleton in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other singletons in the player''s row. Play continues until one player has no counters.', '"Puhulmutu, ‘Ash-pumpkin Pearls.’ \n\nIn this game the player takes the five seeds out of the hole into which the last one fell, and in the same way as before sows them one by one in the next and the following holes, going on round the board in this manner until the final seed falls into an empty hole, called puhuwala, or pussa, on which the player stops, or ‘sits down.’ His opponent then begins at any hole on his own side, and plays in exactly the same manner until the last seed of those which he is sowing also falls into an empty hole, after which the first player begins afresh \nat any hole on his own side of the board, and repeats the sowing. When a hole has three seeds in it, it must be passed over without receiving any seeds, excepting, in its proper order, \nthe last seed of the set which a player is sowing. When this falls into such a hole he captures the four which are now in that hole (tun-indin kanawa, "eats (them) because of the three dates ’), and puts them aside in his separate enclosure provided for them at one end or side of the board. He then takes the seeds of the next hole, if there be any, and sows them \nas before, and continues his play round the board ; but if the next hole to that at which he effected the capture be empty his turn is ended, and he ‘ sits down.'' The opponent now \nresumes his play, beginning at any hole on his own side, and plays in the same way. Towards the latter part of the round a single seed in the last hole on a player’s side cannot be taken as the starting-point if any other hole on his side of the board contain one, or more than one. When all the seeds on one player''s side of the board have been captured, or more \ncorrectly when a player is left without seeds in his row of holes on his turn’s coming to play, the round is ended. Each player then again arranges his seeds in fours in the cup-holes, taking for the purpose any that were left in the holes on his side of the board, together with those captured by him. Any surplus ones are left in the rectangular hole belonging to him. It will almost always be found that one player possesses fewer seeds than the other. If they have equal numbers (termed hari mutu, "equal pearls"), it is optional to consider the game ended in a 1 draw.’ But if one player have fewer than the other the game must be continued. \nAfter they are replaced in the holes, in case a player be without seeds at only one hole he is said to be a ‘ person blind of one eye'' ( ekas hand) ; if at two holes, a ‘ person blind of two \neyes 1 (daes hand) ; if at three holes, he has no special name, but his side of the board is described as '' four-eye,'' referring to the four cups which alone contain seeds ; if there are only seeds for three holes it is * three-eye ’ ; if for two holes, '' two-eye 1 ; if for one hole, '' one-eye/ The player whose seeds are deficient is said to have ''become blind’ ( kana weld). \nThis nomenclature is applied in all the four games. The '' blind ’ person must now commence the play, sowing the seeds in the direction of his empty holes, which are left at one end of his row, and are marked by bits of twig or straw being placed across them to indicate that they are * blind. During the whole of the round no seeds can be placed in the '' blind ’ holes by either player. In other respects the procedure in this and subsequent rounds is exactly the same as in the first one, with the exceptions to be now noted. In all the four Kandian forms of the Olinda game, when the player whose seeds are deficient finds on placing the usual four seeds in the holes at a fresh 4 round ’ that he ends with only one seed for the last hole, this seed is termed his '' son ’ (puta) ; if he have two seeds for it they are called '' younger sister’ (naga) ; if three seeds they are his ''slave’ (mala). Although seeds are sown as usual, by both players, into these three holes those in the first two, containing a puta or naga. cannot be taken out and sown, and are also free from capture throughout all that round, and continue to accumulate for the benefit of their owner ; but those in the wala hole have not this privilege, and are sown and captured as usual. In its case the name is only a descriptive expression, and does not affect the play. To balance these privileged holes the opponent removes one, two, or three seeds respectively from his last hole before the play begins afresh, so as to make up the sum of four when those left in the hole are added to the seeds in the ‘ blind ’ person’s last hole. Thus, if the latter player have a puta, his opponent must end with a wala, or vice versa ; and if he have a naga the other must also have a naga. The same names and privileges apply to these holes on both sides of the board. The puta and naga holes are distinguished from the rest by having some mark, such as a bit of paper or straw, placed in them. As the seeds in these cups cannot be taken out and sown, the turn of the player whose last one falls into either of them comes to an end. When a player finds himself left with less than twelve seeds at the beginning of a round, he has the option of arranging them among the holes in his row in a different manner. He may place two seeds, or only one seed, in each hole, beginning from one end of the row of holes, the last hole on his side in that case receiving any surplus seeds, not exceeding four. For instance, if he have nine seeds, and if, as is usually the case, they be playing to the right, he will place two in each of the four holes on the left ; the next two holes will be left empty, and are 1 blind '' and cannot be played into ; and the ninth seed will be placed in the last hole on the right. The opponent’s distribution is unaffected by this, and he places the usual four seeds in the holes in his row. The game now becomes rather complicated, as the two persons play in different ways. The opponent plays and effects captures in the usual manner ; but the '' blind ’ player only makes a capture when his last seed falls into a hole containing two seeds, whether on his own or the opposite side of the board, in which case he takes the three. If he placed one seed in each hole at the commencement of the round he would make captures when his last seed fell into a hole which contained only one. Otherwise, excepting when playing his last seed, all such holes on both sides of the board with two seeds or one seed, respectively, are passed over by him and do not receive seeds from him when sowing, although his opponent sows into them. On the other hand, the * blind * player no longer passes over the holes with three seeds, but sows his seeds into each of them. As a general result of this mode of playing, the person who was 4 blind ’ often regains his lost seeds, even when he has been reduced to one seed at the beginning of a round, and the game becomes nearly interminable, and may last for hours. In order to bring it to an end quickly, a method termed ''Cutting Ash-pumpkins'' ( puhul kapanawa) is sometimes adopted. According to it the player who is deficient borrows a seed out of each of the last two holes on his opponent''s side, and places these in the adjoining two holes on his own side. He must then begin his play at the next or third hole ; and the borrowed seeds are returned when his opponent is about to commence sowing. There is another method of cutting short the game by a player''s moving a seed, or two, on the opponent''s side, and then commencing to sow from other holes than the first three on his own side."

The game resembles Game 8 in that players move in a clockwise direction when starting from any of their three left-hand holes and in an anti-clockwise direction from their three holes on the right. Each player starts his move by picking up the entire contents of any of his holes and then drops these balls one by one into the ensuing holes, his own or his opponent''s. The move comes to an end when the last of these balls has been dropped, for one does not pick up balls to continue a move as is so common in Ethiopia as a whole. The object of the game is to capture holes, which is done, as in many games, by dropping the last ball in any hand into a hole containing three balls which are thus increased to four. Such captured holes, corresponding to the weg of other areas, are known as walda, but can only be captured in certain parts of the board. Each of the two players can thus only make a walda in one or other of his own end holes, or, on his opponent''s side, in the two end holes and the two penultimate holes from either end.

After all the horses of a single contestant are in play he may move the same horse continuously. In counting, the pockets from A to either of the nearest corners is 15. It is optional with the player whether he turns to the left or right upon leaving the door, though he must move his horse round the rectangle in the same direction after once starting. If X throws 15, moveing to a, and W throws the same number, enabling him to move to the same point, he kills, or throws X''s horse out of play, and he must start his piece over again; and again, if he should throw 14, he accomplishes the same result (there is no 1 in the stick count). However, if X should get to c and W throw 10 from house and get to d, he does not kill him. If on the next throw W throws 14 and X has not moved from c, he kills him. A horse must run entirely around the rectangle and back into the house pockets, where he is safe from being killed; but to make him a winning piece, the exact number to count to a must be thrown by the sticks. When a horse is on a pocket adjoining a, a 2 throw is considered out. The object of the game is to carry all the horses around the pockets and out again at a, the first player succeeding in this being declared the winner."

This game as played in Ceylon and Southern India is called Siga by the Indian Arabs and Muhammadans; but it is a totally different game from the Siga of Arabia. It is played by Sinhalese and Tamils on a board of 81 squares, 9 being ion each side. The middle square (katti) of each side, and the central square (tachi) are marked by two diagonal lines. The plain squares are called kodu in Tamil or gaeta in Sinhalese. Two enormous hollow brass dice termed Kemadi are used for it; they have rounded edges and are of a peculiar shape, being 2 1/4 inches long, 1 1/14 inches wide in the middle, and narrow at each end, where they are less than half an inch wide. They are rolled between the palms and then along the table or floor. Each is marked thus, by holes through the shell, on the four sides. Each player has two barrel-shaped counters, called Topparei, with round tops on which is a little knob, one pair being coloured red and the other black. The game ay be played by two, three, or four persons, each one playing for himself, and beginning at one of the Katti; if there be two they sit on opposite sides of the board. The aim of each player is to get his counters to the central square. At the commencement, each player''s counters are placed in the Katti on his side of the board. the players then roll the dice in turn. The numbers uppermost are added together, and the sum may be used as the distance for moving one counter, or it may be divided in any way for securing suitable moves for both. When both dice show the same number uppermost the player has an additional roll. No one can refuse to move his counters; one or both must be moved to the extent regulated by the dice if there be room for them. The counting goes round to the right, excluding the Katti from which the counters start. The arrows on the diagram show the direction taken by the counters of one side; those on the other sides move in the same manner. While in the crossed squared they are safe from attack, but in the plain ones it is the aim of the opponent to ''chop'' them, as it is termed. This is done by passing over of his counters into or over their square, upon which they must begin afresh from the first Katti. To permit them to do this their owner must obtain two ones on the dice, even when only one counter is required to enter. This puts them into the first Katti, ready for moving onward at his next throw. For getting into the central Tachi, the exact number of pips required must be obtained; therefore it is advisable to bring the two counters up to it together, and not to pass one out before the other is close to it. When both are near it any score on the dice can be divided, so as possibly to enable both counters to pass out together, or one can be passed out alone, if necessary. A further difficulty arises owing to a rule that if the number required be 1 this figure must be obtained on both the dice at one roll, even when there is only one counter left. In the same manner both dice must show threes or fours for passing out either a single counter or both if they be only three or four squares off the centre. Up to this distance both counters pass out as easily as one." Parker 1909: 605-607.', 100, 'Walter.Crist', 1, NULL),

In the opening phase, players play simultaneously. When the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole, the contents are picked up and sowing continues. Each player plays until their final counter falls into an empty hole; the first player to do so begins the main phase. In the main phase, players alternate turns, and picking up the counters and continuing to sow when the final counter lands in an occupied hole, and stopping when the final counter lands in an empty hole. There are some restrictions with regard to sowing. Each of the player''s three leftmost holes cannot be sown from to begin a turn if they contain three counters or less, unless there are no other options for play, in which case sowing must occur from a hole with one counter, and if none are available, then it must begin from a hole with two counters, or three counters if that is the only option. Separately, if the player''s other holes only contain two or three counters, the player must play from a hole containing two counters, and these must be the option closest to the opponent''s holes. Players must also play from holes containing more than three counters when available. During sowing, a player may not drop a counter into any of the opponent''s holes which contain three counters (except when making a nedf, see below), skipping over them and sowing in the next available holes. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the opponent''s row containing three counters, this hole becomes a "nedf." Any counters falling into the nedf cannot be sown. Only one nedf can exist at one time. After the first nedf is made, any others can only be made by placing the final two counters of a sowing into holes which contain three counters, the penultimate hole becoming the new nedf. The player then continues their turn with the counters from the final hole. The hole after the nedf becomes the yazab tabaqi, or "guardian." While the yazab tabaqi contains exactly three counters, the opponent cannot create a new nedf. Play continues until one player has no counters to move, or concedes they can no longer make a nedf.\n', '"The Traditional Aristocratic Gabata: Selus...Current research indicates that this game, though now dying out, is still a monopoly of the higher classes.

The counters in a captured hole cannot be sown, but when any player drops their final counter into it, two counters are captured from it. If the player captured counters from one of the holes that they had created, they begin sowing again from another of their turns, but if the capture was from a hole captured by the opponent, the turn ends. The leftmost holes in each player''s row are special: a player may under no circumstance capture counters from this hole in their row, but may do so from the opponent''s, gaining another turn when they do so.

This game, based on three rows each of six rows (sic) with three balls per hole has similarities with Games 2 and 3 as reported from northern Tigre, and was played by Sagaye Gabra Michael, a student from Tigre brought up at Massawa now attending the Teachers'' Training Institute at Asmara, who refers to it as selus. Players would move alternately, picking up the contents of any of their holes and distributing them in the manner described in Games 2 and 3. The procedure for capture was however entirely different. After the initial rearrangement of balls each player would be able to effect a capture, either on his own side of that of his opponent, by dropping the last ball in his hand into a hole containing three balls which were thus increased to four. A player could not pick up the contents of such a captured hole as from any ordinary hole, but could capture from it whenever he dropped the last ball there,, irrespectively of who had captured it or on whose side it lay. As long as such a hole contained balls the player would put aside two balls, the ball he dropped there and one he found there but should the hole become empty he would, as with weg hole in other games, take only one ball, I.e., the ball alighting there. A player thus "eating" from one of his holes he had captured was entitled to continue his move, but was not allowed to do so after taking from one of the holes captured by his opponent. The two left-hand corner holes, known as ayeni or "eye," had special significance (though not the same as in Games 2 and 3) for a player could not "eat" from the captured "eye" on his side, only from that of his opponent, after which he was entitled to continue his move.

A rough checker of 5x5 squares is drawn on the ground—usually on a firm stretch of sand on the beach. The middle rows are somewhat broader than the others, and their squares bear distinctive names: A = ''ayn, in Arabic, "spring," or "eye"; B= dafandaf; C = habarti, "the mother." Each player has four men of a distinctive kind (stones, shells, pieces of wood, etc), which he places on one of the ''ayn. If only two people are playing they choose two ''ayn opposite each other, but if there re four players all four ''ayn are occupied. Instead of dice, four cowire-shells are thrown, and the way they fall determines the number of squares each is entitled to move.

If a man passes over other men which are of a different colour from his own, and which are not in one of the ''ayn, it is called suldan ("sultan") and each overtaken stone is a qabid (Arabic, "slave"): the slve has to go back to his ''ayn of origin, and the owner of the suldan can make an extra throw for every slave he has made.

Beginning from the leftmost hole closest to a player and proceeding in an anti-clockwise direction, the opening arrangement of counters is an alternating pattern of one empty hole, followed by two holes with three counters each. The first move for each player must be from an occupied hole in the right half of their row. Players sow in an anti-clockwise direction, but if the final counter is about to fall in a hole in the player''s own row, it is instead placed in the first hole in the opponent''s row. After this, players may sow from any hole in their row, provided that the final counter does not fall into an occupied hole in their row. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole in the opponent''s row, the counters there are picked up and sowing continues. When this happens, the player is allowed to drop the final counter into an occupied hole in their row, which would then be picked up and sowing would continue as before. When the final counter falls into an empty hole in the player''s row, any counters in the opponent''s hole opposite are captured. When the final counter falls into an empty hole in the opponent''s row, the turn ends. Play continues until one player''s row is empty of counters, and the opponent wins.

The game a recreation of adult males, and to a lesser extent boys and youth, is played, usually on wooden boards with seeds as balls in the open air or, during rains, in houses or just outside them in the shelter of the roof. The following games were played by Shaka Oto of Olanta near Baqaele...Tagega I: Tapata. This game, based on two rows each of 12 holes is called tapata, perhaps after the Konso people of that name. Three balls are initially placed in each of four pairs of holes on either side and are arranged as follows:...The game is unusual in having not one opening move, as in Game 36, but two basically symmetrical opening moves, one for each player. The first player was thus obliged to begin play from an occupied hole on the right half of his row, and would usually do so from one ot other of those nearest the centre of the board. Having picked up the contents of one such hole he would proceed in an anti-clockwise direction, but should the last ball in his hand be about to fall in one of his own holes he would jump over it so as to alight on his opponent''s side. his move would then come to an end, and his opponent would effect a similar gambit from a hole on the right half of his row, again preferable from one of the two holes nearest the centre of the board, and would likewise avoid terminating his hand in one of his own occupied holes. Play would then proceed more or less on the lines of Game 44 from Hadiyra or Games 47 and 48 from Walamo (Yado)...Players were now free to start anywhere on their side of the board provided that the last ball in their hand did not fall on one of their own occupied holes, and jumping, as in the two opening gambits was no longer permissible...Captures, as in the Hadiya and Walamo games just referred to, were effected by a player dropping the last ball in his hand into one of his own empty holes opposite an occupied hole belonging to his opponent, in which case the former player appropriated the contents of the latter''s hole, and it was his opponent''s turn to play. The player left with counters in his row won the game.

This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player''s turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent''s hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it if their last counter falls into it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent''s captured hole, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player''s holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent''s holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra they draw lots to see who gets an extra hole. Play then begins again as before.

A player cannot bear off when the player has one or\r\nmore pieces trapped inside the player''s home section. A player bears off by rolling a number\r\nequal to the number of points left in the track of a piece, plus one. If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, then the player must make a legal move using a piece that will not remove it from the board. If there are no pieces available to fulfill this, the player must remove a piece that is furthest from the goal. The first player to bear off all fifteen pieces wins the game. If the losing player has\r\nborne off at least one piece, they lose only one point. If the losing player has not borne off a\r\nsingle piece by the time the opponent has borne off all of their pieces, then the player loses two points.

Placing pieces on the twelfth point of a player''s side is only allowed when it can be achieved by two pieces on the same dice roll.

If the hypothetical hit is in the opponents'' nearest half of the board according to the track, the player scores two points, four points if it was achieved by rolling doubles. If the hit is in the further half of the opponent''s side of the board, the player scores four or six if made by doubles. There are other ways of scoring points. If a player can place a piece on each of the first six points after the starting point after their first three rows, they score four points.

Players throw out a finger (index, little, or thumb) to determine who plays first. index beats thumb, thumb beats little finger, little finger beats index. This happens at the start of each round. Counters are taken from any of the holes in the player''s row, sowing them in either direction, including the stores.

Stores are considered to be empty, except when its large stone remains in it, then the large stone only can be sown or captured and not any other counters that may have accumulated there. Large stones can be sown in any order a player chooses during a sowing.

Each of the player''s three leftmost holes cannot be sown from to begin a turn if they contain three counters or less, unless there are no other options for play, in which case sowing must occur from a hole with one counter, and if none are available, then it must begin from a hole with two counters, or three counters if that is the only option. Separately, if the player''s other holes only contain two or three counters, the player must play from a hole containing two counters, and these must be the option closest to the opponent''s holes. Players must also play from holes containing more than three counters when available. During sowing, a player may not drop a counter into any of the opponent''s holes which contain three counters (except when making a nedf, see below), skipping over them and sowing in the next available holes.  When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the opponent''s row containing three counters, this hole becomes a "nedf." Any counters falling into the nedf cannot be sown. Only one nedf can exist at one time. After the first nedf is made, any others can only be made by placing the final two counters of a sowing into holes which contain three counters, the penultimate hole becoming the new nedf. The player then continues their turn with the counters from the final hole. The hole after the nedf becomes the yazab tabaqi, or "guardian." While the yazab tabaqi contains exactly three counters, the opponent cannot create a new nedf. Play continues until one player has no counters to move, or concedes they can no longer make a nedf.', 'Pankhurst 1971: 165-166.', 'Horn of Africa', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0,5520'),

If the hole is occupied, sowing continues. If the hole is empty and the opposite hole is unoccupied or it is one of the opponent''s holes, sowing ends. When one player can no longer play because the holes on their side are empty, the opponent captures the remaining counters on the board. A new round begins.

If no capture is available, a counter may be placed in any occupied hole in the inner hole except the square hole, and sows them in either direction. If the square hole is the only occupied hole in the inner row, the counter is placed there and the player sows only two seeds from it in either direction.

Twenty pieces per player, arrayed on the dark-colored spaces. The square in the left-hand corner closes to the player is a dark square. Pieces move one space forward diagonally. When a piece arrives at the furthest rank opposite their starting position, it becomes a king. Kings may move diagonally, forward or backward, any number of spaces (like a bishop in Chess). Captures are made by hopping over an adjacent piece in a diagonal or orthogonal direction, including backwards. Multiple captures are allowed, in which the player may change direction. Kings capture by flying leap. Captures are mandatory, and the maximum capture should be made based on the value of pieces. Kings are worth less than twice the number of regular pieces, but more than twice the number of pieces minus one. (e.g., three kings are worth less than six pieces, but more than five pieces). If more than one maximum capture has the same value, the one that captures more kings takes precedence. It is permitted to use the same space more than once, but not to hop over the same piece twice. Captured pieces are removed after the turn is complete. The maximum capture can be enforced when the opponent catches it, though the opponent may opt not to point it out. A king cannot make three non-capturing moves in a row without moving another king or piece. This rule does not apply if the player only has one king remaining. If one player has only two kings remaining and the opponent has only one king remaining, the player with two kings must win in seven turns. If they do not, the game is a draw. If both players have only one king remaining and neither of them is able to capture or will be forced into a position where their king will be captured on the next turn, the game is a draw.
