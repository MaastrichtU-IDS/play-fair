'Janggi, sometimes called Korean chess, is a traditional strategic board game symbolically representing a battle between the Chinese states of Han (漢) and Chu (楚). To play the game, each player starts with sixteen pieces standing for a general, guards, horses, elephants, chariots, cannons, and soldiers. This board was made with several wooden blocks joined to each other to make four legs, and covered with three wooden plates fixed with two wooden nails on each side. Four of the pieces (one guard and three soldiers) are unlabeled, as the originals have been lost. The bag for holding the pieces is woven with hemp thread.'

Venda chiefs trace their ancestry back to the founding hero, Thoho ya Ndou, who is said to have led his people into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe. After founding his capital at Dzata in the Soutpansberg (c.1700), Thoho ya Ndou is said to have disappeared into Lake Funduzi, and to remain there to this day presiding over a court in the water, which is a replica of those of living chiefs. These ndilo appear to depict this lake kingdom of the founding hero, while simultaneously being metaphors for the courts of living chiefs.
The subjects of the king were summoned to the central court of the capital, where they were seated according to their sub-groups in concentric circles around the bowl and the diviner. The bowls were filled with water so that the crocodile on the bed of the bowl became immersed within a lake. The central mound topped by the cowrie shell was filled with magical substances; it projected above the water level, apparently referring to the mountains against which the chiefs’ capitals are built. Maize kernels were floated on this water and, as the bowl tipped or rocked on the bosses of its convex underside, the places in which they touched the rim were noted. Carved all around the rim are images representing animals which denote the different emblems of Venda subgroups, as well as designs drawn from Venda divining tablets, thangu. Thus, the pints at which the kernels touched the rim would indicate which subgroups the witches belonged to, as the divining tablet would shape their gender.
Any kernels which sank to the bed of the bowl would be interpreted according to which signs they touched there. These include two pronged shapes indicating the chief’s wives, a semi-circular enclosure indicating the cattle byre, a straight zig-zag line denoting both the path to the capital and lightning, and a bird-like form referring to the ‘lightning bird’ said to lay eggs at the point that lightning strokes.
The designs on the underside of the bowl further amplify this picture. Around part of the rim of the underside, the bowl is decorated with a further chevron pattern said to represent the python that writhe son the edge sof pools and lakes. Concentric circle designs are called ‘the eye of the crocodile’ and interlace designs refer to its skin. 
This particular bowl is one of the few that have survived and is an exceptionally elaborately carved example. It has attached to it other objects used by diviners. Bowls of this kind were counted among the dzingoma (Mysteries/relics) of the chiefdom.
T. Phillips (ed.), Africa, the art of a continent (London, Royal Academy, 1995) pp:201; Eth.Doc.2014. H J Braunholtz in an article in the BMQ, XVII, 1, June 1952 notes that the bowl was acquired by the donor about 1911 after the owner's conviction for witchcraft. He states that such bowls (ndilo) were formerly used by professional diviners (mungonia) for revealing the identity of witches (muloi).

Covers Inscription note: The right bottom corner of the board has been broken, eliminating the letters following TE.  Gatti suggests that it could have read TECTAE, in reference to the doors of the Circus being closed, or covered, while spectacles took place.","Gatti calls this a tabula lusoria, of which a further 4 had been found in, and just outside of Rome. He suggests that the first two lines are formulaic, referring to the activity of the Circus, but that the wording of all 5 boards varies in the 3rd line.
  
‘Tabula’ was usually a gambling game, and probably a later refinement of a version called ‘Duodecim Scripta’, or ’12 lines’.  Each player had 15 pieces each, which were moved around the board in opposite directions, according to the roll of three dice.  A piece resting alone in a space on the board was vulnerable to being ‘hit’.
There are three incised patterns on the centre of the board, suggesting that this is in fact a gameboard for Duodecim Scripta; these markers were removed by the later version of ‘tabula’, leaving just two rows on each side of the board.

The players usually call Snakes & Ladders by the name ""Ludo"" and it has become more popular than the Ludo game itself, also known as ""Ludo"". There are a number of different rules different from the regular Sorry! game known in Kiribati (see John McLeod, The Playing Card). The game uses a full deck (i.e. it includes the 6 and 9 commonly excluded in Sorry!); 6: move 6 squares ahead; 7: move 7 squares ahead (normally this card allows you to split a move into any combination that makes 7); 9: split your move into parts that make 9 (as traditionally with a 7 card); 11: you can exchange a piece with another one except those in the innermost circuit; 13: (Sorry! card) again you cannot touch the pieces that entered the innermost circuit.","de Groot 2018 / Kiribati Game Development:Cultural Transmission, Communities of Creation, and Marketing",Not on display,,,,,,,,Purchased from: Alex de Groot,,,,2018,The donor was given the game-board by two people in Kiribati.

With the decay of the wood the whole of the encrustation of the upper surface had sunk down into the void so left, while the strip-work along the sides remained sticking up above it; this collapse had resulted in the dislocation of much of the fine mosaic border, and the regularity of the surface was disturbed, the shell squares often lying at an angle and the lapis strips overlapping them; further, the end of the larger section had been broken and the three last plaques (all except the corner of that on the left, which was still attached) and the right-hand plaque of the next row lay separated from each other and half an inch or more away from the main board, and the border and edging here had been scattered. It was this broken end that we found first and probably some pieces of the strip edging were overlooked by us; when the presence of the object was recognized we worked along it a square or so at a time, pouring hot wax over it as we went, and finally the whole was secured with waxed cloth and lifted. It has not been taken to pieces and remade. The inside was cleaned and covered with waxed muslin and the cloth and wax removed from the face and then it was placed face downwards on a sheet of glass and by applying heat we were able to push the component parts down into their places; the three loose plaques were replaced in the order in which they were found, but nothing was done to restore the missing part of the border and edging. The red and blue spots inlaid in the shell plaques and petals of the flowers were loose in their sockets when found, but were fixed by the wax poured over them and very few of them have been disturbed and replaced [n. A few floated up in the liquid wax but could be at once pushed down into their holes]"". The object was reconstructed by the WAA conservator I G Tremayne following sagging through a build-up of intense heat in the gallery (Report to Trustees 5 July 1961).
An important point to note, often forgotten, is that this was a hollow box and not a solid board: it was therefore a much more delicate item than the present reconstruction suggests and the interior of the box contaiined the pieces and the dice, just as the silver version did when excavated in another grave. Moreover, there are several other boxed sets for this game found in this Cemetery: the others are in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad and on display (viewed 2018). Another version carved entirely of wood was excavated in a grave at Shahr-i Sokhta in eastern Iran, and inlaid versions of a yet different style excavated in the 'Royal Cemetery' at Gonur depe in present-day southern Turkmenistan. The origins of all are thought to lie in the Indus valley.; Various replica versions, more or less based on the original, have been made and marketed, for instance by BMCompany and Ludibundus (Christmas 1980 sale catalogue).",Woolley et al 1934a / The Royal Cemetery; Barnett & Wiseman 1960a / Fifty masterpieces of Ancient Near Eastern Art; Grunfeld F V 1968a / The mystery game of Ur; Du Ry C J 1969a / Art of the Ancient Near and Middle East; Marseille 1991 / Jouer dans l'Antiquite; Finkel I L 1995a / Board games and fortune telling: a case from antiquity; Aruz & Wallenfels 2003a / Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus; Lhôte J-M 2005a / Hypothése concenant le tablier du jeu royal d'Ur; Becker A 2007a / The Royal Game of Ur; Finkel I L 2007a / On the Rules for the Royal Game of Ur,On display (G56/dc16),"Exhibited:

The game first appears in Egypt  before 2000 BC, and was popular there and across the Ancient Near East throughout the second and first millennia BC. Many discoveries show it to have been played at all levels of society. The present example is one of several evidently expensive and prized boards excavated by Layard.

Totopoly is a horse racing game which involves moving horses around a board according to a throw of the dice. Bets may be placed on the horses with the paper money supplied with the game, and paper prize money is also paid out to the wining horses. In the English edition the horses are named after the winners of the Lincolnshire Handicap between 1926 and 1937.

Mark Hall was stationed at the British Embassy in Tokyo from 1969 to 1973.  During that time he developed an interest in the game of go, and in 1973, at the end of his stay, he received the go board as a gift from one of the embassy’s Japanese employees, who said it had belonged to his grandfather.  Mr. Hall had the top of the board planed and professionally refinished at that time.  He ordered and acquired the stones, bowls, yellow cloth cover and wood cover during a trip to Japan circa 1992.  Over the years as he travelled to new postings, the set travelled with him.  In 2012, the board was displayed at the Imperial War Museum.
This set centres on a traditional, professional level (19x19 grid) Japanese ‘floor board’:  a thick, solid wood board with a square recessed area (heso) on its underside to deter warping and impart a pleasant resonance to the ‘click’ sound when stones are firmly set in place (a part of go etiquette).  It is the most expensive type of board produced.  Signs of wear around the sides of the board reflect use over time and travels with the donor.  Also of high quality are the slate and shell stones, the latter perhaps being of tsuki (moon) grade (the middle grade of shell stones).",,Not on display,,,go,,,,,Donated by: T.

The game's popularity may partly stem from the fact that it is easy to play anywhere. The pieces are seeds, shells or whatever comes to hand, and the boards can be dug into the sand or dirt, or even carved into rock. Wood is a popular material, partly because of the satisfying noise that 'sowing' the pieces into the holes makes. Unlike chess, mancala is not a quiet game, and the noise of play is often accompanied by the shouts of the players.
Two players or teams take it in turns to drop their pieces into the holes, moving them around the board in a set direction; the name 'mancala' comes from an Arabic verb meaning 'to move'. The aim is to capture as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.
Two-row mancala is the most popular version of the game and the easiest to play, but there are also three- and four-row boards. The name mancala is a generic term - the game actually goes by numerous different local names, and has a wide variety of playing rules. The two best-known versions are ayo, played in Nigeria, and wari, which is played across West Africa and the Caribbean. 
Boards from Sierra Leone are noted for their decorative openwork bases. These are clearly more time-consuming to make and more expensive to buy and may be regarded as prestigious objects owned by people of high social status.; Register 1953:

Hand-coloured etching
18th Century",Print made by: Anonymous,,,,,,,18thC,Published in: France,,paper,,,etching; hand-coloured,"Height: 270 millimetres sheet ; Width: 226 millimetres sheet ","Inscription type: inscription Inscription quoted: Printed in the centre is ""Le Jeu de Nain Jaune"".","Information from Allan Valencia (personal communication, 29 October 2012): 
The game of the Yellow Dwarf was popular from about 1760-1800, enjoying a resurgence from about 1850-1870, and another from about 1920-40.  Mr Valencia's version, probably from 1850-1870, is in the form of a wooden box with a sliding lid, a little over 8 inches by 12 inches and about 2 inches deep; the inside back of the box has a similar design to the present example, although differing in detail.  Five removable cardboard boxes fit into the space, the four corner boxes having the inside corners truncated at an angle to make room for the square center box.  Each box has the same design in its bottom as the corresponding image on the back of the box.  This version came with a number of bone counters - two sizes of disks, two lengths of rectangles - in a number of different colours; there was probably originally also a pack of cards. The game can be played by 3 to 8 players. Each player starts with the same number of counters (50 is mentioned a number of times, but more might be needed for a longer game).  At the start of each round, each player places counters in each box, which represent the bonus cards - one to the ten of diamonds, two to the knave of clubs, 3 to the queen of hearts, 4 to the king of spades, and 5 to the 7 of diamonds, which is the Yellow Dwarf.  In most game terminology, these initial 15 counters from each player would be called the ante.  Each player is dealt an equal number of cards based on the number of players present, and a certain number of cards are set aside and not used in the game play for that round (3 players- 7 aside and 15 each player, 4 players- 4 aside and 12 each player, 5 players -7 aside and 9 each player, 6 players -4 aside and 8 each player, 7 players- 3 aside and 7 each player, 8 players - 4 aside and 6 each player). Setting aside some cards serves two purposes - one is to deal with the problem of the total card count not dividing equally among the players, and the second is to introduce ""stoppers"" to add interest to play - this increases the number of times when a sequence will end and a new one needs to be started. The player to the left of the dealer starts the round by laying down any card he chooses, then building up on that card in rank regardless of suit (Ace to King) till he can no longer continue.  The play then continues to the left with each player continuing the sequence.  If the King is reached in the sequence, the current player can start a new sequence using any card in his hand.  If all players have to pass because they can't play a card, the first player to pass can begin a new sequence using any card from his hand.  If a player plays one of the bonus cards, he takes the counters from the box for that bonus card.  If he forgets to take them, he forfeits them and they remain in the box for the next round.  The first player to lay down all his cards wins the round.  He receives counters from the other players based on the face count of the cards left in their hands (face cards are valued at 10, the rest 1 to 10, as marked). If the first player to start the round lays down all his cards in that first turn, he also takes the counters from all 5 boxes as an extra reward to the penalties he collects from the other players.  Laying down all cards in the first turn was called an ""Opera"".  If a player has one of the bonus cards remaining in his hand at the end of the round, he must pay an additional penalty by putting a number of counters into the box for that card to double the box's total counter value (if there are 10 counters in the box, the player adds an additional 10).  This is in addition to the 15 counter ante at the beginning of each round.  At the end of a round, if any of the bonus cards have not been played, the counters in those boxes remain for the next round and are then added to by the ante for the next round.  It seems that all 52 cards are shuffled at the beginning of each round and  the appropriate number set aside  again in the deal.  If any player doesn't have enough counters to pay at any point, the game ends and the winner is the player with the most counters. The different sizes appear to represent different values.
This game appears to be related to the game Pope Joan, possibly the result of a confused translation of Nain Jaune as ""Nun Joan"".",Schreiber / Catalogue of the collection of playing cards bequeathed to the British Museum by Lady Charlotte Schreiber,Not on display,,,,,,,,Bequeathed by: Lady Charlotte Schreiber,,,,1896,,,Prints and Drawings,,"1896,0501.1290.1",,,

""Game players make a trip by steam boat from Rotterdam to Dordrecht (Dordt) however it has to be the opposite direction since the Old Main Gate (De Oude Hooft Poort) on 60 was located in Rotterdam. It was demolished in 1856. On 26 we pass the town of IJsselmonde (Yselmonde) and on 42 Dordrecht (Dordt).
Since the invention of the steam engine and the first successful commercial use in 1807 it became a popular theme for games. The first steam boat company in The Netherlands, founded in 1823, was a commercial failure. Three years later, in 1826, the Amsterdam Steamboat Company opened a service between Amsterdam and Zaandam. This successful enterprise explains why  at least ten different race games were inspired on the popularity of the steamboat in Holland.
Your game had an Amsterdam version as well. The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam collection includes a printed sheet with rules of Het Stoomboots Spel based on the service between Amsterdam and Zaandam. This game was woodcut by Aron Hijman Binger and published by the well known Amsterdam Hendrik Moolenyzer who produced several games between 1883 and 1842.""

Hand-coloured etching",After: Gilles de la Boissière;  Published by: Jean Mariette,,,,,,,1691 (after),Published in: Paris (France),,paper,,,etching; hand-coloured,"Height: 85 millimetres individual card ; Height: 553 millimetres sheet ; Width: 55 millimetres individual card ; Width: 740 millimetres sheet ","Inscription type: inscription Inscription quoted: At the lower right corner 'A Paris, chez J. Mariette, rue St. Jacques aux Colonnes d'Hercules, avec Privilége du Roy.' At the bottom left 'Inventé et dessiné pars Gilles de la Boissière, ingénieur ordinaire du Roy.'
The title explains the function of the game: 'LE JEU DES FORTIFICATIONS. Dans lequel les differents ouvrages qui servent a la defense des places et des Camps sont exactement dessinés selon la plus nouvelle maniere avec toutes leurs definitions et une explication courte et facile des termes qui sont en usage dans cet Art.' Throughout the print are instructions for its use: They begin 'Ce Jeu souffre toutes les differentes espece de jeu qui se jouent avec les Cartes ordinaires…'","Designed by the royal engineer Gilles de la Boissière and dedicated to the local, noble students of the Jesuit Lycée Louis-Le-Grand, the 'Game of Fortifications' teaches specialized military knowledge about the planning, construction and function of fortifications. The sheet could be cut down to form a deck of playing cards or played as a board game with subject-specific rules. These include having to pay a penalty when landing on triangular or square-shaped fortifications, which are deemed 'areas of poor defence' (spaces 10 & 11). Players are then allowed to move to the pentagonal fortification on square 12, judged the ideal structure to repel attacks.
The dating of this version of the game is based on the fact that Jean Mariette inherited his fathers shop at the Colonnes d' Hercules, Paris,  in 1691. It is only after this date that he began publishing material under his own name. The game survives in five different editions. These were published in Paris by Jean Mariette, Daumont and Crépy, and N. JB du Poilly, in Amsterdam by Pierre Mortimer and in London by John Lenthall. A later copy of the game with German inscriptions was published in Amsterdam by Peter Schenk and in Augsburg by Johann Ulrich Stapf. Impressions of the editions published by Mariette, Daumont and Crépy, Schenk and Stapf are in the collection of the British Museum.
It is possible that Boissière also etched the sheet.

This game of 'Courtly Philosophy', published together with a short guide-book, was created by the minor Spanish nobleman Alonso de Barros. He casts his players into the role of ambitious courtiers seeking advancement. De Barros substitutes geese with spaces marked 'travaglio' [work] that allow players to jump to the next 'travaglio' space. Pitfalls such as 'false friendship' and 'death of the favourite' send them spiralling back down the track. The game ends at the 'palm of victory' which springs from the shore of the 'sea of suffering'.

Alonso de Barros was a minor noble who served as an aposentador  in the court and is best known for his collection of proverbs, 'Proverbios morales', 1598. In 1587 he published the Filosofía Cortesana in Madrid, a short book describing the game and how to play it. This book is best-known now among Hispanists because it contains an introductory sonnet written by Miguel de Cervantes. A copy of this edition is in the Emmanuel College Library and was located by Edward M. Wilson in the 1960s. A second Spanish-language edition was published by Josep Cacchij in Naples in 1588. It seems likely that this gameboard would have accompanied this edition.  There is a modern facsimile version of the Filosofía cortesana, edited by Trevor J. Dadson and published in Madrid in 1987 (Information provided by Dr Rachel Schmidt. Email 20 may 2010).

The key exceptions are the spaces featuring beggars [baroni], who instead allow the player to take a small amount from any money wagered on the board. The central 'Capitano di Baroni' is after the title-page of the famous series of beggar etchings by Jacques Callot.

It is a so called race game, to be played with dice. The title refers to the then popular German war march song. While England was still preparing for an attack from Germany, the Blitz Krieg could already be played in this game. From Bremen (Deutsche Bocht) the players could choose from two routes, for U-boats and aircraft. The box contains cards with specifications of English warships.

This game of propaganda was commissioned by the German government to encourage people to save raw materials for the war effort.   'Jagd auf Kohlenklau' is printed by Leptien-Schiffers for Werbeagentur (Advertising Agency) ""Arbeitsgemeinschaft Hohnhausen"" in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1943-1944, with a print run of 5 million.  On the blue squares a boy is saving energy, on the red squares we see 'Kohlenklau' and examples of wasting energy.  The game was distributed free as part of a large  campaign with the same slogan.  A 'Kohlenklau' quartet game was also produced, probably for sale. One of the quartet cards says ""Ohne Kohlen kann kein Krieg geführt werden"" ('without coal war is impossible'). Unusually for Nazi propaganda, the 'Kohlenklau' character does not have a Jewish appearance; at the time most Germans suffered food shortages, but 'Kohlenklau' clearly is overweight. At this period paper and ink were scarce; but the game is well printed in bright colours on board of reasonable quality. The gameboard was distributed folded, in an envelope, without dice or pieces. The rules are printed on the game. The game is not especially rare; it does not show swastikas or other nazi symbols, so probably many German families kept it to play after the war.",,Not on display,"2019, 18 Apr-29 Sep, BM, Gallery 69a, Playing with Money: Currency and Games",,political propaganda,,,,,Donated by: Petra Gesche,,,,2004,,,Prints and Drawings,,"2004,1231.15",,,

Brambilla's game-board is the earliest dated example of pelachiù [pluck the owl], a popular gambling game in which players wager a stake of money [quattrini] on the board. They then look for the space which corresponds to their throw of three dice and follow the instructions: 'T' indicates they should take the specified number of quattrini from the pool and 'P' that they should pay it into the pool. A triple throw wins half the stake, and a throw of three sixes wins the game. Owl figures illustrate the most profitable spaces, whilst others feature vignettes of street-traders and entertainers.
(Text from Michael Bury, 'The Print in Italy 1550-1620', BM 2001, cat.103.)
The name of the game means 'pluck the owl'. It involved throwing three dice, identifying the place that corresponded to the throw on either the inner or the outer oval and then carrying out the written instructions. 'T' means tira that is the instruction to take the number of quattrini ('Q') indicated; 'P' means paga that is the instruction to pay out the number of quattrini indicated. A throw of three sixes takes all.  
The idea will have been to buy one of these prints and stick it down onto a hard surface of some kind in order to form a game-board. The game is listed in the Vaccari stocklist of 1614 as 'Il giuco del pela Chiù', along with a small group of other games, including the famous 'Oca' (Ehrle, 1908, p.62). It also appears in the 1648 De Rossi inventory documenting the division of the inheritance from Giuseppe de Rossi the elder (Consagra, 1993, p.512). It evidently remained popular, for there were boards still being produced in the eighteenth century (Bertarelli).
The language of the inscriptions points to a source in north-east Italy. This example has the address of Giovanni Battista Panzera, an engraver and printer from Parma who had shop in the Borgo in Rome. A number of Brambilla's works carry his address. Perhaps as a result of his contacts in the north of Italy, he had copies made of other prints that had been published there, most importantly Agostino Carracci's two great engravings after Correggio: the Madonna of St Jerome and the Ecce Homo.",,Not on display,"2001/2 Sep-Jan, BM, P&D, The Print in Italy 1550-1620

In the two top corners are the rules of the game.","(Edited text from Michael Bury, 'The Print in Italy 1550-1620', BM 2001, cat.103.)
The name of the game means 'pluck the owl'. It involved throwing three dice, identifying the place that corresponded to the throw on either the inner or the outer oval and then carrying out the written instructions. 'T' means tira that is the instruction to take the number of quattrini ('Q') indicated; 'P' means paga that is the instruction to pay out the number of quattrini indicated. A throw of three sixes takes all.  
The idea will have been to buy one of these prints and stick it down onto a hard surface of some kind in order to form a game-board. The game is listed in the Vaccari stocklist of 1614 as 'Il giuco del pela Chiù', along with a small group of other games, including the famous 'Oca' (Ehrle, 1908, p.62). It also appears in the 1648 De Rossi inventory documenting the division of the inheritance from Giuseppe de Rossi the elder (Consagra, 1993, p.512). It evidently remained popular, for there were boards still being produced in the eighteenth century [of which this is one].; This is a late impression, andf stamped with the catalogue (?) number 1885",,Not on display,,,,,,,,Donated by: Lady Charlotte Schreiber,,,,1893,,,Prints and Drawings,,"1893,0331.55",,,

Engraving",Print made by: Ambrogio Brambilla;  Published by: Giovanni Battista di Lazzaro Panzera da Parma,,,,,,,1589,,,paper,,,engraving,Height: 398 millimetres; Width: 519 millimetres,"Inscription type: inscription Inscription quoted: Lettered with title at top and in centre 'Romae Baptiste Parmensis formis 1589' and the monogram of Brambilla. In the four corners are the rules of the game, beginning 'Questo foglio il bel gioco s'appresenta / Di pela il Chiu venuto in luce adesso / Col qual se fugir l'otio si talenta / ti potrai trattener tal hor con esso.'","(Text from Michael Bury, 'The Print in Italy 1550-1620', BM 2001, cat.103.)
The name of the game means 'pluck the owl'. It involved throwing three dice, identifying the place that corresponded to the throw on either the inner or the outer oval and then carrying out the written instructions. 'T' means tira that is the instruction to take the number of quattrini ('Q') indicated; 'P' means paga that is the instruction to pay out the number of quattrini indicated. A throw of three sixes takes all.  
The idea will have been to buy one of these prints and stick it down onto a hard surface of some kind in order to form a game-board. The game is listed in the Vaccari stocklist of 1614 as 'Il giuco del pela Chiù', along with a small group of other games, including the famous 'Oca' (Ehrle, 1908, p.62). It also appears in the 1648 De Rossi inventory documenting the division of the inheritance from Giuseppe de Rossi the elder (Consagra, 1993, p.512). It evidently remained popular, for there were boards still being produced in the eighteenth century (Bertarelli).
The language of the inscriptions points to a source in north-east Italy. This example has the address of Giovanni Battista Panzera, an engraver and printer from Parma who had shop in the Borgo in Rome. A number of Brambilla's works carry his address. Perhaps as a result of his contacts in the north of Italy, he had copies made of other prints that had been published there, most importantly Agostino Carracci's two great engravings after Correggio: the Madonna of St Jerome and the Ecce Homo.; This is a late (19thc) impression, blind-stamped 'Regia calcographia di Roma'",,Not on display,,,,,,,,Donated by: Lady Charlotte Schreiber,,,,1893,,,Prints and Drawings,,"1893,0331.32",,,

Records of the goose-game in Italy date back to 1480. Soon popular across Europe, this is the first known impression to carry a date.

The image in the centre depicts two roughly dressed labourers loading and unloading a donkey with heavy sacks. Their labour relates to the play of the game as landing on spaces inscribed with the word 'carica' resulting in the player 'loading' two quattrini into the game-pool, whilst spaces inscribed with the word 'scarica' allow them to 'unload' six quattrini from the game-pool. Spaces with the word 'nulla' result in no action.

Here, each space illustrates a different profession and corresponds to a different possible throw of two dice. Landing on the first twelve professions is profitable for the player, who takes a payment from the pool. The final eight professions involve the player making payments into the game-pool. The 'Painter, Engraver and Sculptor', where Mitelli playfully situates himself, is identified as the last and least profitable profession of them all.
